This license is more a statement and clarification of how we were operating in the past and will continue to operate in the future. 

TiTS was never (and still is not) open source; the source code being publicly available does not mean that the project was open source. The lack of an explicit licence applied to the code by definition implies the project was never open source, as the code falls under standard copyright protections with some minor additional rights granted to third parties by virtue of being present on Github; chiefly enough rights granted to be able to fork the repo for each users own personal use.

At some point in the future a more permissive license may be applied to the project, granting irrevocable permissions to build upon the content and distribute those changes at-will.

On the contents of this repo
=====
Trials in Tainted Space and its content, be it code, writing, or art, is copyright OXO Development LLC. The contents of the game may be modified for usage in testing for bugs and submitting new content to the game. Public distribution of Trials in Tainted Space in a compiled form is expressly forbidden unless granted written permission by Fenoxo or another representative of OXO Development. Plagiarizing code from Trials in Tainted Space for any other project is again, expressly forbidden.

On submitted content & code
=====
Submitting content or code for use in Trials in Tainted Space licenses all rights to use said content in Trials in Tainted Space, Trials in Tainted Space merchandise, and future games in the Trials in Tainted Space universe to OXO Development. This includes character designs, written text, and any accompanying art. Consequently, OXO Development is free to develop content for these characters in the future with or without the original author's consent. We try to remain cognizant of the original author's intent, but sometimes disagreements happen and we must have the capability to build upon existing content.

On getting permission to distribute a compiled version of the project (Modding)
=====
Written permission to use the Trials in Tainted Space code in a mod may be granted by OXO Development on a limited basis. This permission may be removed at a later date, and the author required to remove his or her mod from public distribution.
