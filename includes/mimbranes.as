/*Codex
Name: Mimbrane, Graft, Epidel, Second Skin
Sex: Asexual
Height: .0004 - .25 in. Typically ranges between the slightest fraction of an inch when resembling a thin film to a quarter of an inch when dense and/or well fed. 
Length: 6 - 36 in2. The parasite’s ability to distribute its mass to control its surface area can usually put it anywhere between six and thirty six square inches.
Weight: 100 - 340 grams (.2 - .75 pounds)
Hair: None of its own, but able to replicate host features
Tongue: None
Eyes: Two tiny eyes protected by a thick portion of dermis that can act as eyelids. Round with bright sclera, thin redish iris, with average sized pupils. The eyeballs can vary in size, sometimes changing in size as the Mimbrane integrates into a host.
Senses: Mimbrane feature small fleshy mouths below and between their eyes that protrude slightly from their form, typically thicker than the rest of the creature. Their mouth is used to breath, ingest liquids and communicate as most creatures, but if the parasite is able to latch onto a host organ with an orifice, it will ditch its normal mouth in favor of utilizing the newfound hole as its own. Without a properly sized orifice to borrow, Mimbrane will maintain their normal mouths, anxious to pass them off as small lumps with no seam. Information on how the creature feeds and breathes can be found below.
A Mimbrane’s most important organ is its skin. Its normal appearance is a light red or pink, lighter in color the thinner the creature stretches itself and more vibrant the more dense it is. Mimbrane are smooth and free of any discolorations or imperfections. They can appear as thin square sheets, slightly moist and glistening as they glide through the air or crawl along the ground. At their largest sizes, Mimbrane are incredibly lithe and become somewhat translucent.
The parasite is able to prorate its sparse mass in order to control its surface area, allowing it not only encase its prey, but also fly and glide with relative ease. The creature’s more well-known trait is its ability to transform and alter its epidermis, mimicking its host’s every detail. More information on this feature can be found below.
Armor: Due to its lean nature, Mimbrane rely more on their ability to dodge and conform to any shapes in order to help defend itself. Sharp blades and projectiles that actually do make contact easily injure the creature. Blunt weapons are normally ineffective. A Mimbrane’s primary offense and defense lie within its lust-inducing oil and spit, explained further below.
Environs Typically Inhabited: Though the creatures can exist in most any habitat, Mimbrane tend to prefer natural and wooded areas, locales comprised of abundant sources of warmth and nutrients.
Means of Attack: Mimbrane tend to be docile creatures, hiding from potential prey whenever possible. The cause of this is the extreme toll battle can take on the parasite. A single creature can take months to accumulate enough nutrients just to work up the reserves necessary to employ their lust attacks in addition to the above average energy expenditure. In other words, a Mimbrane that has decided to attack is putting its all into the effort.
A Mimbrane’s primary means of offense are targeted to their opponent’s carnal instincts. Its first attack is more passive, as the parasite’s skin secretes a clear oil, tinged lightly with a bright pink color. Contact with the parasite’s oily skin can wreck havoc on its opponent’s sexual craving. A byproduct of a Mimbrane’s sweat is the pungent cloud of ecstasy it produces; the parasite will periodically stress its pores and fan this gas towards their opponent. The creature’s more direct attack has it gather and concentrate its oil, spitting a particularly volatile batch of libidinal craving that bursts on contact.  
While Mimbrane rely primarily on their ability to drive their opponents to sexual madness, they also utilize their light form to try and temporarily smother their hosts. This attack doubles the effectiveness of their oily skin as well. The few physical attacks of the parasite involve it creating tiny barbs along its surface and brushing against their opponent and fairly weak attempts at tripping up an opponent.  
Parasitism: A Mimbrane’s primary goal in life is to attach to a host, feed, and slowly reproduce. Once it has properly subdued a target, the parasite will work its way towards its intended body part. An interesting facet of these creatures is their inherent organ preferences, shared among the entire species. These baked-in predilections place importance on ease of acquiring liquid sustenance followed shortly thereafter by warmth and relative seclusion on the host. 
Mimbranes prioritize sexual organs, preferring penises over vaginas. Should the genitalia be either non-existent or claimed by other Mimbranes, the parasite will opt for the posterior, enshrouding the entire rear end and anus to account for its less-than-optimal choice. The next option for a Mimbrane would actually be the scrotum followed by the breasts, the lower and warmer sac an easier location for remaining secluded over the typically much more exposed breasts. And when all known sexual organs are unavailable, the parasite will opt for extremities, typically the hands and finally feet. 
The face is actually avoided when choosing a roost as it is typically a very sensitive and hard area to maintain for the parasite. Attempts to hide anywhere on or around the head more often increase the creature’s presence to the host. As a result, Mimbrane will rather reject a host than place themselves somewhere they believe would lead to their quick removal.
Once a Mimbrane has chosen an organ, it quickly goes to work encapsulating the entirety of their selection, forming a perfect seal. From this point, mimicry becomes the primary goal of the parasite. The Mimbrane’s epidermis will integrate itself with its host’s nervous system, forwarding sensations on to nerve endings and feeling as if nothing were on the organ at all. Dead skin cells and sweat are passed through the creature if they are not able to be consumed.
The parasite also works to visually represent its chosen target, detailing every bit of texture, coloration, hair and imperfection that they’ve covered. In only a few scant minutes, a Mimbrane’s pink, featureless, slick skin will perfectly resemble its target down to the last hair, freckle, or scar. Once the transformation is complete, a motionless Mimbrane becomes almost unperceivable to its host, save for a few telltale signs.
The most visible indications of the parasite while they are attempting to mimic their chosen organ often appear as lumps of skin or enlarged body parts. The first sign is the bunching of the parasite’s skin along the base of their connection to the host. This acts as the creature’s defense from unassisted removal, painlessly digging into the host’s skin and alerting the parasite to any attempts to pry it free. The other visible trait are typically two tiny bumps close to the host’s orifice, where the Mimbrane hides its eyes. 
The final telltale mark is only when the parasite has bonded with an organ that does not feature some sort of cavity. A third bump will appear, hiding the creature’s small mouth. The lumps protecting a Mimbrane’s mouth and eyes have no visible seams, and the parasites will typically try to push these few remaining marks of evidence down against their host in an effort to better hide them. More information on the parasite’s tendencies when coupled with a host can be found below.
Feeding: A Mimbrane can survive on sources of moisture such as plants, fruits or water, but it cannot reproduce until it has found and attached itself to a host. If it has clung to an organ that features some sort of orifice, it will dissolve its mouth in favor of substituting it with its newfound outlet. If there is no orifice, the Mimbrane will maintain its small mouth, trying its best to disguise it as an innocuous bump on its host. 
The mouth is where a Mimbrane continues to feed and breathe. The parasite is unable to continue breathing through its epidermis when coupled as its skin is currently occupied mimicking the host. As a result, the creature will wait for moments of inactivity to move its mouth open and close, stirring fresh air around and allowing it to easily absorb and process oxygen. The sensation – whether with a claimed hole or the creature’s mouth – can very easily be felt by the host and is the most glaring reminder of the parasite’s presence.
Mimbrane ingest host secretions that pass through their borrowed mouths by absorbing them into the skin surround the opening in a manner similar to breathing. This action does not require the same amount of movement, however and usually goes undetected by hosts. The exception goes for parasites lacking a borrowed spout, who use their natural mouths in a manner similar to all other living creatures in order to collect what they crave. When located on extremities such as hands, Mimbrane will attempt to push themselves to a visible source when hungry. 
Due to their slow and miniscule metabolism, the parasites only require a small fraction of the various discharges they can come into contact with. Most Mimbrane are unable to engorge themselves rapidly, which acts as a countermeasure from growing too large too fast, thus increasing their odds of irritating their hosts and reaching their demise. 
Reproduction: Mimbrane store and process any and all nutrients they come into contact with once in contact with a host. As a result, the body part they’ve encapsulated can appear to swell over time. The parasite can easily grow anywhere between twenty five and fifty percent of the size of the organ it currently resides over. People with swollen penises, vaginas, asses, or anything else never feel as if their organs have been smothered with the extra weight due to the creature’s continued mimicry and faked signals it sends to the nervous system. 
Once a Mimbrane has reached a large enough mass – roughly at least double its original mass – it will begin asexual reproduction in a form similar to binary fission. The parasite begins by preparing the host for the bizarre sensations, which are described to feel as if removing large bandages, onaholes, or other sorts of coverings after a long period of time. If it fears for its safety, the parasite will wait until the host is asleep.
A separation begins to occur along the perimeter of the Mimbrane’s original size. Over the course of an hour or two, the parasite will center its consciousness on the skin still attached to the organ and finish severing all of the extra mass its accumulated over the course of a number of weeks. At this point, the growth will fall or merely slip off of the host, still appearing like an enlarged copy of the organ it shed from. The faux organ will convulse and spasm for a few minutes, signaling the growth of the new consciousness. 
The new Mimbrane can survive in this state for tens of minutes, feeding off the excess stores of nutrition left to it by its parent. Some more experienced hosts have been known to enjoy the offspring for the time it exists as an engorged copy of their body part. The new Mimbrane’s mind briefly revolves around its memories as the body part in this state.
Eventually it will settle and unravel back into its original form, flooded with the continued instincts and knowledge that is always passed down throughout the creation of the parasites. Mimbrane prefer to spread to new targets and will abandon their parents as soon as the opportunity arrives.
Intelligence and Behavior: Evolution has taught this race to be patient and polite in order to increase odds of survival. Mimbrane intelligence is just above that of common house pets, surprisingly. The parasites rely on their lust-increasing secretions to attain hosts, but they cannot afford to continue to rely on them once they are in place. This forces the creatures to interact with their host as little as possible, relying on their mimicry, downplayed movements, and slow growth to conceal themselves as long as they feel they are in danger of aggravating their host, driving them to attempt and remove them.
Once Mimbrane believe they’re in little harm of being forcibly removed from their perch, they may open up a little to their host. The parasite will more freely control its claimed organ in plain view of its host, responding to stimuli such as movement and sound like any other sentient creature will. The parasite will attempt to form and maintain this bond in order to help ensure its survival if it thinks it can make it work.
As time and trust continue to build, Mimbrane can eventually reawaken their latent capabilities used when capturing prey, helping their host by waging the same spitting and secretion-based attacks against their opponents’ sexual drive. These strikes require a good degree of the nutrients the parasite has stored from the host, nutrients that are typically reserved purely for reproduction and self-sustenance. As a result, these actions can only be used sparingly by the creature when they feel open enough to aid in combat.
Getting a Mimbrane confident enough to act like this is quite a feat as this runs contrary to the species’ normally shy nature. A Mimbrane’s first instinct once it has attached to a host is to mimic and hide in plain sight. Even when the parasite has fully confided in its host, it will generally hide from all strangers. 
What they won’t hide from are their fellow parasites. Mimbrane are highly sociable among one another, and people playing host to several of them may discover just how chatty the little guys can tend to be. No matter what form they may appear in, Mimbrane will utilize their mouth to make high-pitched squeaks to communicate with one another.
Mimbrane will also come to the aid of their brethren when possible. If they discover their host is in combat with another of their kind, they will sweat the same lust-inducing oil that host-free Mimbrane use to subdue their prey. This can turn an individual’s armor against them as the parasites will use it as a pressure cooker for sexual fervor. Once the host has been humbled, existing Mimbrane already clinging to them will announce their presence and work together to signify any remaining key organs for the new parasite to claim as their own. This behavior can easily lead to an individual being overrun by the parasite if they continually encounter them.
Finally, Mimbrane will continue to aid one another on the same host by making certain any parasites without orifices to feed from are taken care of. It isn’t uncommon for an individual with several Mimbrane to frequently lose control of much of their body as the parasites communicate and feed one another if the fear of discovery and removal is low. This group mentality is exclusive to the parasites only when a host is present; they do not typically come to one another’s aid and work together alone in the wild. 
Removal: Mimbrane’s incredible mimicry and tendencies to aid their hosts when they aren’t avoiding their ire is simply due to the fact they perish if they are ever removed from their host. The act of integrating into an organism’s nervous system is second nature to the parasite, but they will die of shock should they be pried away. Unaided removal is highly discouraged, as the parasite can easily utilize its connection to the host to paralyze them with signals of pain or pleasure.
Mimbrane can utilize their natural defenses in addition to anything the organ at their disposal can grant them to defend themselves against others as well. Individuals with a great number of parasites across their body can even provide a challenge for medical professionals. Caution is recommended when dealing with anyone in a situation like this; the parasites will easily wrestle control away from their host when fueled by adrenaline and defend themselves. 
Contacting an anesthesiologist is the best approach to removing Mimbrane from an individual. The parasite’s need to breathe makes it susceptible to being knocked out and easily removed. There is rarely any lasting damage or scars to hosts.

Parasite Mechanics and Effects
All numbers in this section may be subject to change.
Preferred Order of Attachment
Mimbranes will attach to the PC’s body in a specific order, ideally prioritizing nourishment, seclusion, and warmth. Parasites will only skip to the next organ when previous organs have been claimed by other Mimbranes or the PC does not have the organ. If the missing organ appears later, new Mimbranes will target it before the organ next in the list (e.g. a male PC becomes a herm by gaining a vagina, but already has parasites on their dick, ass and balls. The next Mimbrane will target the new pussy before going for breasts or hands). 
Head Mimbranes require all attached Mimbranes to be at at least level two trust before they can be gained. They will start at level two trust.
Breasts must be more than flat (A cup+) to be a target for Mimbranes.
If by some happenstance, a PC has testicles and no dick, then they’re skipped as well.
The order is as follows:
Penis(es) > Vagina > Ass > Scrotum > Breasts > Hands > Feet > Head
Removal and Body Part Change Denial
Mimbranes can only be removed at medical centers and must be removed en masse, i.e. all or none. Any other attempts to remove the parasite will result in either pain to the PC or attacks towards anyone else that attempts to remove them. Mimbranes removed from the PC will perish.
The parasites will not hinder any transformations – the only exception to this is for feet. Mimbranes will only attach to two human feet and will block any attempts to transform them once they have claimed them. This is strictly for the first pass at the parasite and can be expanded to include the many feet transformations in the game at a later time if requested. 
However, Mimbranes will block attempts to remove the organ they are attached to. The only way to remove an organ that Mimbranes have attached to is to kill off all Mimbrane parasites on the PC first.
Trust Score
Mimbranes naturally hide from their hosts, blending in to the best of their ability and reserving their behavior such as breathing and reproduction when they believe their hosts won’t notice. Through actions by the PC and being able to successfully reproduce, each parasite will slowly begin to trust that their host isn’t out for their demise and is, in fact, working to their benefit. This is registered in game simply as the trust score. Trust is increased simply by interacting directly with the parasites and as they are able to reproduce. 
Trust is only lost when infected body parts are neglected and go unfed and is also lost from other Mimbranes when a neglected Mimbrane is ignored for an extended period of time. More on this in the next section.
Currently, the trust score is on a five point scale from 0 to 4. Effects that are shared by all parasites are as follows:
0: At no trust, Mimbranes will appear to lay dormant. They will not react to the PC outside of feeding and very rarely will expose themselves in order to breathe. New parasites start at 0 trust until a parasite at 2 trust exists on the PC. This will cause any new parasites to start at 1 trust. The only way for a Mimbrane to go from 0 to 1 trust is to successfully reproduce.
	Level Up: One reproductive cycle required to advance to 1 trust
1: Mimbranes at 1 trust will still hide from their host naturally, but they can occasionally be spotted looking around with their eyes.
	Level Up: One reproductive cycle and two feedings are required to advance to 2 trust 
2: Level two trust parasites are cautiously optimistic of their host’s intentions. They will not act very much on their own, but they are incredibly receptive to attention from the PC. 
	Level Up: One reproductive cycle and three feedings are required to advance to 3 trust
3: Parasites at this level rarely hide from the PC. This trust level unlocks the ability for the PC to request the Mimbranes to “sweat” their natural lust-increasing oil. This is controlled over all 3+ parasites with a global toggle.
	Level Up: Two reproductive cycles and five feedings are required to advance to 4 trust
4: Mimbranes at maximum trust can randomly augment the PC’s lust attacks by breaking free and spitting at opponents. PCs that have enabled sweating Mimbranes may also occasionally find Mimbranes creating lust clouds that they will fan towards opponents. These attacks can be disabled with a global toggle. Parasites at this level are very active and never hide from the PC unless strangers are around.
Feeding Mimbranes
Most Mimbranes are able to feed whenever a scene revolving around their body part takes place. A scene will not take place for this, nor will it go towards increasing trust. Put simply, dick parasites are fed when the PC cums, anal when the PC is penetrated anally, vaginal when penetrated vaginally, and face when penetrated orally. 
Mimbranes on balls, hands and feet must always be cared for separately, as they are not sharing an orifice and will hide during contact with strangers.
Hand and feet Mimbranes are always fed and interacted with their “partner” simultaneously if possible as well. As a result, the second foot or hand Mimbrane will match the first existing Mimbrane in appearance, falling under the same feed tracker for both feet or both hand Mimbranes.
Each time a Mimbrane feeds, it grows a little bit. If it is fed manually by the PC, it grows by a larger amount. These growths are detailed more specifically in the listed effects section below and in Reproduction.  
Mimbranes can go for one week between feedings. If they reach a week without being fed, they will start to rebel, detailed in the next section. 
Due to their slow metabolisms, Mimbranes can only be fed once per day. Manual feedings by the PC will fill a parasite up more efficiently than if they were to feed through normal sex, and they will employ the same default 24 hour waiting period until the critter can feed again.
Regardless of trust level, all Mimbranes will participate in a PC-triggered feeding session if they are not full.

Ignoring Mimbranes
These little guys are patient critters, but they aren’t invulnerable from basic cravings. Mimbranes that have found hosts will never starve; there’s plenty of errant secretions and moisture flinging around for them to last out the PC’s lifetime. But these meager drippings aren’t enough to keep the parasites silent and content forever. As mentioned in the previous section, Mimbranes will only go one week without being fed until they try and drive their host a little crazy.
After five days without being fed, a Mimbrane will subtly try to get their host’s attention. When the little critters are at a trust level of at least 2, their shuffling may be a little more overt.
Towards the end of the sixth day without sustenance, Mimbranes will try one more time to get attention. Low trust level Mimbranes will only shuffle a little more intensely. Parasites at a trust level of at least two will overtly cry out to their host.
Once the PC has entered the seventh day of depriving a Mimbrane a meal, the parasite’s trust level will drop by one. Its trust level will continue to drop by one more point every additional two days it goes without. In addition, if a Mimbrane goes a total of nine days without food, all attached parasites’ trust levels will go down by one. Their trust levels will continue to drop by a point every three days after that.
In addition to the trust decreases, the moment a Mimbrane hits the week mark without food, it will begin to secrete its lust-increasing oil in an attempt to get the PC horny enough to get busy and see to their desire. Unlike the oil secretions gained from trusting Mimbranes, this effect targets only the PC and increases at a quicker rate. That rate is 1 point of lust every hour. If this weren’t enough, on the eighth day, all other attached Mimbranes will begin to sweat oil as well, each increasing the hourly lust gain by one point. This makes for a potential of gaining up to around 10 points an hour for neglecting just one Mimbrane.
On top of everything else, various factors in combat will be employed, such as the possibility to lose a turn. Look below in Unlockable Combat Effects for more details.
SO, in summary:
New Mimbranes start at 0 trust.
If a Mimbrane exists at a minimum of 2 trust, then all new Mimbranes start at 1 trust instead.
Mimbranes can go for a week between feedings
Feedings can be either via manual feedings from the PC or from scenes that focus on that organ
Mimbrane organs with only mouths and no orifices (feet, hands, scrotum) require manual feeding and will not feed from a scene.
On the seventh day, hungry Mimbranes will sweat and increase the PC’s lust gain to 1 point every hour. They will drop their trust level by one.
Every two days, the hungry Mimbrane’s trust level will drop another point.
On the eighth day, all attached Mimbranes will sweat and increase PC’s lust by 1 point for every other parasite.
One the ninth day, all attached Mimbranes’ trust levels will drop by 1 level.
Every three days, all other Mimbranes’ trust levels will drop by 1.
Various combat effects are enabled when a hungry Mimbrane is active.  
Mimbrane Reproduction
Mimbranes store and process all food, forcing their organ to grow larger until they are ready to split off all gained weight into a new parasite that leaves to start its own life. All Mimbranes require 15 servings to get them big enough to produce a child. Once a Mimbrane is ready to reproduce, it can no longer be fed and will perform the act the next time the PC goes to sleep.
Feedings through sex scenes count for one serving. Manual feedings performed by the PC count for three servings. Either of these feedings will result in a 24 hour waiting period before the parasite can feed once more.
Each feeding will force a Mimbrane (and thus the organ size) to swell to varying degrees. Organs with variables will go up by percentages while organs without variables (e.g. hands, feet, face) will only have appearance text changes.
Specific Body Part Effects
All Mimbranes create various effects once they’ve bonded to a PC. Most are positive, some could be negative. These vary depending on the body part. Most all stat changes have 15 different variables depending on how fed the parasite is. This variable resets to base level when it reproduces.

Lose .4% willpower with each feeding. Grand total loss of 6% to willpower stat after 15 feedings.
Hands Mimbranes
If two hand Mimbranes are present, both are always in sync with one another. The second Mimbrane will match the first upon arrival.
Three different mentions of hands in appearance text. Three feedings mentions that hand(s) appear(s) distended slightly. Eight feedings changes the text to hand(s) appear(s) puffy.  Thirteen feedings changes it to mention that hand(s) appear(s) unusually large.
Hand Mimbranes at ≤ 2 trust that have gone four days without feeding have a 5% chance to waste a turn groping the PC. Two hand Mimbranes increase this chance to 10%. When trust is > 2, percent chances decrease to 3% and 5% respectively.
Hand Mimbranes at trust level 3 have a 15% chance to produce an extra attack when using an HP-targeted attack. Two hand Mimbranes means two 15% chances for extra attacks. When hand Mimbrane reaches level 4 trust, the chance increases to 30%
Lose .4% willpower with each feeding. Grand total loss of 6% to willpower stat after 15 feedings.
Feet Mimbranes

Your {[cock]/[pussy]/[ass]} suddenly starts making high-pitched chirping and squeaking noises! It seems as though the Mimbrane that already conquered you has detected its brethren. The bizarre manipulation of your body, your orifice puckering and undulating of its own volition, is strangely turning you on and making it difficult to regain your composure. 
The muffled sounds from your {crotch/rear} reach your new opponent, causing the parasite to take pause and chirp back. You’re left a little confused as the brief conversation goes on for another few moments. The silken sheet in the air before you tenses up yet again, presumably ready to fight you. But just as you try and do the same, you’re distracted by yet another strange occurrence within your [armor].
A damp spot on your {groin/butt} plants a seed of worry within you. Prying open your garments to investigate the issue blossoms that seed in a hurry as your senses are blasted with an overwhelmingly thick cloud of noxious ardour originating from under your protection. The scent is a more concentrated variant similar to the Mimbrane before you. Before you reel back in surprise, you do manage to catch a surprising fact: your {[cock]/[pussy]/[ass]} is sweating profusely, absolutely drenched in the clear, light pink oil wild Mimbranes use to assault their prey.

SAME PARAGRAPH{if PC has multiple Mimbranes}Your preparatory combat stance falters a bit when an unusual sensation radiates from around your body. The various parts of you under the watchful eyes of Mimbranes have started to go into a frenzy, all chirping and squeaking to your rather surprised opponent. The commotion feels as if your body is protesting against you, various holes and patches of skin crying out in unison. 
The Mimbrane flying before joins in on the conversation. The chatter between it and your parasitic body parts only manages to put you on edge, unsure of where this unbidden allegiance will go. A moment of silence finally descends just as the wild silken sheet before you tenses back up, preparing to duel.
A secondary attempt to enter anything resembling a combat stance is thwarted as numerous damp sensations perk up along your body. A second later and your olfactory senses are brought to their knees with an overwhelmingly thick cloud of noxious ardour originating from the various Mimbranes on your body. Indeed, they’ve all begun to sweat profusely, coating you in their clear, oily secretion of pure ardour.
The best you can manage against the surprise assault is a coughing stumble away from the unbidden sensual perspiration.

Combat Description
A Mimbrane is flying around you, resembling a slick and smooth cloth at times. The parasite is incredibly thin, appearing not any thicker than a quarter of an inch tall. What it lacks in depth it makes up in diameter, though; it easily sizes up to around a couple square feet. The Mimbrane’s moist, oily skin occasionally glistens in the surrounding light, sometimes appearing slightly translucent as its stretches its lithe form.  The creature’s face is hard to make out a times, little more than two small eyeballs and a slightly protruding mouth that contrast somewhat to the rest of the beast’s uniform appearance.

Mutinous Turn Loss: Your [legs] quiver and shake, a sign of uneasiness as you find it difficult to ignore your [pussy].

Ass Mimbranes

Lust Cloud Attack Misfire: The fight gets harder to focus on the more sweaty and steamy your [ass] gets, spurred on by its parasitic covering. It finally gets to be unbearable when the Mimbrane starts to quake and tremble with unrelenting pressure, clenching your [asshole] tight and compressing your cheeks. You go for your [armor] in an attempt to come to the parasite’s aid, but can hardly accomplish anything as it prematurely disperses its payload, smothering you in clouds of sweet, red lust. Low, apologetic squeaks can be made from your rear as you escape the haze to focus on the {monster}.
Mutinous Lust Cloud: Your enthusiastic [ass] is doing everything in the parasite’s power to throw you off kilter, soaking the seat of your [armor] in oily sweat. The Mimbrane suddenly uses its perch to its advantage, spreading your cheeks wide and letting rip a noxious, nectarous volley of cloudy lust from your [asshole].

Mutinous Turn Loss: Focus fades from your grasp as your [ass] involuntarily rubs its sweaty, sugary skin against the inside of your [armor].

Scrotum Mimbranes

Critical Spit Attack: You feel an unordinary buildup of pressure on your [balls] that doesn’t appear to be cum-related.

The attack explodes upon contact with the {monster}, hitting you with a little splash damage.
Lust Cloud Attack: Your buildup of sweat and steam around your [sack] starts to get to you, forcing you to try and air things out. You’re startled to see a thick red haze emanating from your parasitic sack. The Mimbrane gets to work, furiously swinging your [balls] to force its secretion towards the {monster}. 
Lust Cloud Attack Misfire: The clammy moisture clinging to your [balls] is getting to be too much to bear, forcing you into try and vent some of it through your [armor].

The attack escapes from the confines of your clothing, smothering you in its nectary wanton desire.
Mutinous Lust Cloud: The rivalry against the {monster} halts as you’re distracted by rapid tensing and flailing of your [sack]. The Mimbrane is thrashing your [balls] about wildly, forcing you into your [armor] to investigate. The moment you peek inside, the mutinous sack overwhelms you with a cloud of sexual desire.
Mutinous Turn Loss: You find it difficult to continue your spat with the {monster}, unable to concentrate as your [sack] gets even sweatier and sultrier every passing second. The Mimbranes encasing your [balls] is doing its best trying to throw you off kilter.
Breasts Mimbranes
Spit Attack: You’re shocked when your [breasts] squeak and jiggle of their own accord. Clearly the Mimbrane fused to them has something to share with you, you figure. You open your [armor], shocked when your puppies burst forth, [nipples] blasting shots of concentrated desire straight at the {monster}.
Spit Attack Misfire: The fight halts, distracted by the involuntary noise and jubilance radiating from your [breasts]. You figure the Mimbrane is trying to get your attention in order to serve a dish of sexual surprise. You work to undo your [armor] so the parasite can have its fun, but it accidentally fires the second open air hits your cleavage. Your [nipples], still ensconced within your garments, waste their payload and soak you with slick red liquid desire.
Critical Spit Attack: A powerful pressure builds on your [breasts], proving to be too difficult for you to ignore. You succumb and undo your [armor], surprised when the Mimbrane mounds burst forth. Each of your [nipples] launch extra-powerful doses of liquid lust towards your opponent that explode on contact. The attack is out of control that you even manage to get splashed a little yourself.
Lust Cloud Attack: Things are getting positively balmy within your [armor]. Your [breasts] are absolutely drenched. You quickly try and relieve them with some fresh air, only to be shocked to discover a thick red cloud of potent sensuality surrounds them. The Mimbrane mammaries quickly direct the haze over towards your opponent before either of you react in any meaningful fashion.
Lust Cloud Attack Misfire: Your [breasts] feel as if they’re broiling in a pressure cooker, drenched in moisture. You loosen your [armor] around your neck to try and let off some steam only to be greeted with angry protests from the Mimbrane-controlled breasts. That’s because only a moment later your head is surrounded by a potent cloud of lust-inducing perspiration that the parasite wasn’t finished preparing. You can only recoil, coughing wildly as you stumble out of the gas.
Mutinous Lust Cloud: It gets a little hard to breathe and focus on your opponent as your [breasts] continue sweating to an unparalleled degree. The Mimbrane-controlled mammaries within your [armor] suddenly shake fiercely, slamming into one another. They wind up forcing thick red clouds of pure libido up and out of your garments, causing you to stagger back out of the dense haze.
Mutinous Turn Loss: You’re unable to keep pace with the {monster}, too paralysed as your sweat-drenched {breasts} slink erotically from under your [armor]. The parasite goes further by rubbing your [nipples] against the inside of the garment, doing whatever it can to hinder you.
Hands Mimbranes
//Hand Mimbranes, while sharing stats such as feeding and perks, act as separate entities in battle. Each produce their own separate chance for any combat action to occur.
Spit Attack: You’re taken aback when your hand begins to tremble, fingers jittering. {If hand is armed}You grab its weapon with your other hand before anything can go wrong.{end} The Mimbrane’s face on the palm of your hand appears to be bulging, its mouth creating a large welt that only continues to grow. You only get another moment to stare at the oddity before the parasite thrusts your hand forward, launching its payload of thick, saturated lust at the {monster}. 
Spit Attack Misfire: Jittering and trembling from your hand worries you, but you try and ignore it in favor of focusing on the battle. {If hand is armed}It gets harder to get a solid grip on your weapon, however, and you involuntarily drop it to the ground.{end} Determination drives you to put the sensation behind you, clasping your troubled hand into a tight fist. That’s when you feel a strange protrusion on your palm, followed by an explosive burst of red liquid lust. Turns out the Mimbrane on your hand was trying to ready a projectile for you, but never got the opening it needed to launch it.
Critical Spit Attack: Your hand suddenly clenches into a fist and trembles uncontrollably. You try and figure out what’s going on when the Mimbrane extremity pushes away from you to face your opponent. Fingers flare and the parasite’s mouth bursts open, launching a powerfully potent blast of liquid lust at your opponent. The attack explodes upon contact with the {monster}, hitting you with a little splash damage. 
Lust Cloud Attack: A thick red haze forms around your sweaty hand. You distance yourself from it as far as possible. The Mimbrane-controlled appendage fans the potent cloud of carnal desire towards the {opponent} before you can fall victim to it yourself.
Lust Cloud Attack Misfire: Your eye catches a thick red haze surrounding your sweaty hand. You involuntarily try and fan it away, but somehow manage just to cover yourself in your hand’s passionate perspiration. The Mimbrane chirps at you, probably frustrated over its premature attack being wasted.
Mutinous Lust Cloud: Your Mimbrane-possessed hand continues its sweaty crusade against you by secreting a thick red amorous fog. You decide to grin and bear the parasite’s attack, unwilling to give your opponent an upper hand.
Mutinous Turn Loss: You find yourself unable to act, too distracted by your sweaty hand. The parasite covering it moves your fingers suggestively, hinting at its desire to explore your body rather than aid you in combat. 
Extra Attack: You’re taken by surprise when your hand moves all on its own, quickly mimicking your previous attack. Seems as though the Mimbrane controlling it is eager to come to your aid!
Grope: Your hand suddenly dives into your [armor], anxiously grasping for your {[cock]/[pussy]/bare nether regions} in the hopes of satisfying its craving. You yank the Mimbrane-controlled appendage back, frustrated by its horrible sense of timing.
Feet Mimbranes
//Feet Mimbranes, while sharing stats such as feeding and perks, act as separate entities in battle. Each produce their own separate chance for any combat action to occur.
Spit Attack: An unusual pressure in your [foot] distracts you from the fight, and involuntary wiggling of your toes grabs your full attention. You expose the Mimbrane-controlled appendage to the air just in time for it fire a concentrated mass of pure lust from its mouth at the {monster}.
Spit Attack Misfire: The Mimbrane covering your [foot] is squeaking and squirming suddenly. You’re too focused on your battle to see to whatever is troubling it, however, ignoring the unusual pressure building below your toes. Regret sinks in when you feel that pressure released, your foot covered in the parasite’s passionate projectile that it could no longer contain. 
Critical Spit Attack: Your toes are clenching, involuntarily trying to contain some unusual buildup of pressure. Unable to ignore it, you bring your [foot] out to light, surprised when the Mimbrane extremity pushes towards your opponent! It launches a powerfully potent blast of liquid lust at your opponent. The attack explodes on contact with the {monster}, powerful enough to hit you with a little splash damage. 
Lust Cloud Attack: Your attention slides to your [foot], stewing in uncomfortably dense perspiration. You expose your foot to the air for some relief, only to find it enshrouded in a haze of red carnal steam. The Mimbrane manages to direct it directly towards your opponent in short time.
Lust Cloud Attack Misfire: Your [foot] makes it hard for you to concentrate on the battle, drenched in dense sweat. Anxious for some relief, you take a moment to expose it to the open air. This startles the Mimbrane causing the overactive perspiration, however. It had been building up a cloud of lascivious intentions for use against your opponent, but it instead winds up accidentally shrouding you with it in its panic instead.
Mutinous Lust Cloud: You do your best to ignore your [foot], the appendage soaking in its Mimbrane’s thick sweat and intoxicating aroma. The parasite is working so hard against you, in fact, that it actually manages to produce enough of a haze down from your foot that you start to feel the effects of it!
Mutinous Turn Loss: It becomes difficult for you to continue fighting against the {monster}, too distracted by your [foot] soaking in sexual sweat and being lewdly controlled by its parasitic coating.
Bonus Evade: You’re taken by surprise as your [foot] suddenly acts on its own, right as you’re about be attacked. The action is intense enough to slide you right out of the face of danger. Seems your Mimbrane is even more attentive than you are!
Loose Footing: Your fight takes an abrupt turn when you lose your footing and tumble to the ground. Seems your [foot] was the cause, or more specifically the Mimbrane controlling it.
Head Mimbranes
Spit Attack: A surprising pressure builds over your cheeks, surging towards your [lips]. The Mimbrane covering your [face] forces you into spitting a large, dense ball of pure lechery right towards your opponent!
Spit Attack Misfire: You’re surprised when you feel an odd buildup along your [face], working its way towards your [lips]. The Mimbrane covering your head is readying a dangerous ball of lust to server to your opponent. Unfortunately your timing isn’t precisely matched with that of the parasite’s. A sudden breath on your part clashes with the parasite’s attempt to gather its attack, causing an explosion of misty desire to take place in front of your face.
Critical Spit Attack: Your [face] feels tense, as if an powerful pressure were caving it in. Just when you start to worry, the pressure builds in your [lips], culminating into a powerful blast of liquid lust aimed directly for your opponent. The attack bursts upon contact, hitting you with a little splash damage.
Lust Cloud Attack: Its beginning to get hard to see, your head sweating profusely from the Mimbrane encasing it. Your vision is then covered entirely by a thick cloud of red lust surrounding your head! The parasite works to keep your [face] from inhaling any of its dangerous vapors, instead manipulating it into sending the wanton fog towards your opponent.
Lust Cloud Attack Misfire: Its bad enough that the Mimbrane encasing your head has drenched you in a rich layer of sweat, but now you’re having trouble seeing through the thick cloud of salacious intent that’s forming as a result. You involuntarily go to wipe your brow, which accidentally causes you to inhale some of the dangerous fumes. The parasite manipulates your [face] enough to avoid any further exposure to its premature attack.
Mutinous Lust Cloud: The Mimbrane covering your head is working double time, clouding your [face] with sweat and a fog of lust. You can’t hold your breath forever and eventually wind up inhaling some of the noxious, nectary fumes. 
Mutinous Turn Loss: You’re unable to focus on your fight. The Mimbrane around your head is only increasing its output of oily sweat and salacious fog, making it difficult to ignore.
Lip Tease (small): You make a suggestive kiss towards the {monster} with your less-than-lean lips.
Lip Tease (medium): You lick your plump lips in a suggestive fashion, tantalizing the {monster} with their delicious volume.
Lip Tease (large): You form your luscious, buxom lips into a nice, tight “o,” suggestively positioning the moist face cushions.

Aiding the Hungry
//Occurs on eighth day since feeding

Sweating Mimbranes
//These messages pertain to Mimbranes that the PC has asked to voluntarily sweat. They appear less frequently than hungry and mutinous Mimbrane messages.
Penis Mimbrane: The ever-present moist spot on your {lowergarment} is the telltale sign that your [cock] is absolutely soaked in oily, sexual sweat. The Mimbrane member occasionally rubs against your inner thighs or slides up your waist, tickling you with moist perversion while simultaneously arousing you with each well-lubricated stroke.
Vagina Mimbrane: The pinkish haze around your groin about masks the constant dripping of Mimbrane sweat pouring out and around your [pussy]. Your gait blends the perspiration all along your midsection, ensuring your oily perplexion doesn’t go to waste. 
Ass Mimbrane: Coated in oily Mimbrane persuasion, your [ass] no longer seems to form any sort of traction against your [armor]. Instead, each of your steps merely glides each cheek against the surface, tantalizing you with each whimsical caress. Occasionally small pink clouds of moist, humid, dense lust will escape out into the open, showing a fairly clear trail of where you’ve been. You suspect the parasitic [asshole] is enjoying itself.
Scrotum Mimbrane: It’s actually surprising how comfortable a friendly bath-of-sorts in Mimbrane lubricant can feel compared to when its done in an aggressive fashion. A curtain of oily, tingly lust drapes around your [balls], causing them to effortlessly glide about in your [armor]. The typically oppressive humid shroud that comes as a result of this parasitic perspiration is more pleasant to you as well. Though you still aren’t completely immune to just how much the ongoing oil massage turns you on... 
Breasts Mimbrane: The amusement from having your [fullchest] constantly covered in oily Mimbrane seat hasn’t gotten old to you yet. Your bosom glides freely about in your {uppergarment}, seeming to not even understand the meaning of the word “friction.” Not only that, but occasional clouds of strawberry-scented salaciousness escape your garments and tickle your senses.
Hand Mimbrane: You hadn’t counted on the expert control your hand-bound Mimbrane would impart on its oily secretions. In one instance your lubricated, sex-charged grasp glides effortlessly over all genitalia it encounters. But in another instance, you command a firm grip on your weapon in combat, while refusing to abandon your moist sheen. It’s an impressive feat.

In one instance your lubricated, sex-charged grasp glides effortlessly over all genitalia it encounters. But in another instance, you command a firm grip on your weapons in combat, while refusing to abandon your moist sheen. It’s an impressive feat.
Foot Mimbrane: Blissful confusion is a good description for what your [foot] feels its going through. The Mimbrane-covered extremity is swimming in the parasite’s love-bent secretions, and yet you never lose your footing. The satisfaction of exposing a sweat-drenched, hot foot to the air is one you apparently can cherish continuously as well. But the usual stench of body order has been overwritten by the wanton strawberry aroma that radiates from the creature’s work.

The satisfaction of exposing a sweat-drenched, hot foot to the air is one you apparently can cherish continuously as well. But the usual stench of body order has been overwritten by the wanton strawberry aroma that radiates from the creatures’ work.
Head Mimbrane: You continue to enjoy the passionate sheen you get from the neverending downpour of oily Mimbrane sweat running down your [face]. Even your [lips] glint in the sunlight, their {lipcolor} color mixing with the lightly pink fluid. Any worries that your head would be in a 24 hour sauna melt away by how the almost eerily refreshing perspiration makes you feel. The clouds of carnality that you shed seem to have a larger effect on your surroundings than they do you. 
Breathing Mimbranes
//These scenes can only occur when the PC is waking from sleep. They apply only to Mimbranes with a trust level anywhere from 0 to 2. These have a very low frequency.
Penis Mimbrane: An odd sensation on your [cockhead] drags you out of the haze of sleep you were only slowly stepping out from. For a moment, you thought you caught your urethra widening on its own before returning to normal. You instead figure you just need to get moving around or something.
Vagina Mimbrane: The experience of your [vagina] opening and closing on its own bursts you out from sleep. You could have sworn you felt a faint movement of air around your orifice. However, you find nothing unusual upon inspection.
Ass Mimbrane: A sudden, brief dilation of your [asshole] forces you to bolt up out of tender slumber. You grope around to try and find anything to explain what happened, but find nothing. Must have been an odd dream or something.
Scrotum Mimbrane: When an odd feeling of air moving around and possibly into your [balls] hits you, sleep gets thrown out immediately. You find nothing of note upon inspection, however. You decide to ignore the potential sleep-induced hallucination. 
Breasts Mimbrane: Your [nipples] feel as if they were expanding slightly, pushing a slight bit of air within them. The faint sensation is enough to kick you from the lingering bits of sleep you were enjoying to examine them. You find nothing out of the ordinary. 
Hand Mimbrane: Air seems to inexplicably move in and around the palm of your hand, shocking you out of your half-awake state. Upon inspection, however, you come across nothing strange. 
Hands Mimbranes: Your hands feel as if they were drawing in a little bit of air, a feeling strange enough to hurl you out into full consciousness. They both feel and look fine, however. You chalk it up to your waking mind or something.
Foot Mimbrane: Some air tickles your toes and seems to seep into your foot right below them. The feeling is strange enough that you tumble down from sleep’s embrace to find the culprit. But you leave empty-handed, unable to find anything but your [foot]. 
Feet Mimbranes: Air brushes past your toes and into both your [feet], batting you out of the park and into consciousness. You can’t help but try and find what is going on, but there’s nothing to be found. You figure your sheets must have tickled your feet or something.
Head Mimbrane: An otherwise normal morning of sleeping in runs into a complication. It seems as if air were seeping into your [lips] of all places just as you were taking a breath! However, no amount of pawing and pulling at your mouth cushions reveals a damn thing. You figure its just time to wake up.  
Friendly Mimbranes
//These scenes can occur during any transitions. They apply only to Mimbranes with a trust level of 3 or 4. They have a low frequency and only one can occur at any given time.
Penis Mimbrane:
A bizarre stirring in your {lowergarment} catches your attention. Your [cock] is attempting to poke out into the open air, pushed along by a particularly curious Mimbrane. {Nice: “It’s a little embarrassing, but no one seems to notice. You politely ask the parasite to stow back away, to which it cheerily chirps its compliance.”/Mischievous: “It’s actually quite amusing seeing your trouser snake soaking in the scenery. You let it bob around freely for a while before it eventually returns to its lair.”/Mean: “You huff angrily, grabbing the cock and shoving it back into your clothes. You don’t have the patience for such irritations.”}
{if cock ≥ 30” & lust ≥ 50 & breasts > flat “Your [cock] begins to slide up within your armor, making it hard to focus. This is no normal erection that’s escaping from your {lowergarment}, this is your Mimbrane’s doing. It squeezes your enormous pole comfortably between your [breasts], oh-so-slowly pumping it vertically. You’re unsure if you want it to stop or not.”}
{if lust < 40 “It’s a tad hard to concentrate as your [cock] takes advantage of its rather flaccid state to continuously shuffle around in your [armor]. The Mimbrane seems unable to sit still today, sliding and prodding at everything in your penis’ radius.”}
Your Mimbrane member occasionally works its way down your [leg] like a lewd snake.
Your [cock] slowly rubs lewdly against your [skin] and clothes. The Mimbrane seems to be teasing your cock.
Vagina Mimbrane: 
Your actions are cut short by what vaguely sounds like some whistling coming from your crotch. It’s your [pussy], actually; your Mimbrane has gone beyond its little chirps and squeaks and seems to be trying out something more musical. {Nice: “You believe a symphonic snatch, while interesting, may attract uninteresting attention and ask the parasite to stop. It does with a particularly disappointed chirp.”/Mischievous: “You recall seeing some vid or something that featured a woman with a singing snatch. Yours barely resembles a songbird. It’ll need some training.”/Mean: “You squeeze your thighs together in an attempt to get the parasite to stop. Following with a quick, harsh scold, silence and stillness resumes reign over your genitalia.”} 
{if fairly vaginal wetness “Your Mimbrane seems to be having fun with your [pussy] and its veritable river of feminine fluids. One moment the parasite seems to be blowing bubbles, the next it’s starting and stopping the works, and the next it’s merely producing moist chirps.”}
Your [pussy] nips at your [armor], throwing you for a surprise. The Mimbrane must be feeling playful you imagine.
Your [legs] about melt to jello all of a sudden. Your Mimbrane is messing with your [clit], moving the little fun button around in provocative ways beneath your [armor].
A sudden pressure knocking against your [pussy] about knocks you over. You know there’s nothing there... Is your Mimbrane just messing around with you?
Ass Mimbrane: 
Your eyes go wide when a noisy sound stumbles out from your [ass]. Luckily, it appears you garnered no unwanted attention. It would seem your enthusiastic Mimbrane has taken to playing practical jokes on you, using its unique control of your posterior to produce faux fart sounds. {Nice: “You politely ask that the parasite at least not be too loud. There’s no harm in fun, but there’s certainly harm to be had from certain sources should the racket get out of hand.”/Mischievous: “Funny enough, you begin to cook up some creative outlets for the Mimbrane’s newfound antics. Why only embarrass yourself when it’s so much easier to embarrass others? ”/Mean: “Confident no one of any importance is looking, you grab your cheeks and stop the parasite’s raspberries. You make it clear to the creature that you will have no part in its stupid circus act.”} 
{if asshole is close to gaping or higher “It’s hard to go about your day when your [asshole] pulsates between a gaping cavern and a tight pin hole. Your butt-bound Mimbrane seems to be enjoying your flexible lower chute.”}
Each step you take is exaggerated by a rather large swing of your [ass]. It isn’t long before you clearly suspect the rambunctious Mimbrane of the flamboyant disregard for your gait.
Occasionally your [ass] rubs its cheeks together. You derive no pleasure from the motion, but its entertainingly weird. The Mimbrane just seems to enjoy manipulating your hind quarters.
Scrotum Mimbrane: 
You get a little shaky in the [legs] when your [balls] start to loosen and tensen in succession. The [sack] is acting as if you were cumming. Best you figure, your Mimbrane has formed some sort of attachment to the motion. Understandable considering the state you’re in when it typically happens. {Nice: “You decide to carry on and enjoy the pseudo kegel exercise. It’s doing no harm and the parasite doesn’t seem to be pushing out any [cum].”/Mischievous: “As the parasite manipulates your balls, you begin to imagine if this ability can be manipulated in the sack. Bending your orgasm to your whims could have its benefits...”/Mean: “You come to a dead stop, ensuring no on of any importance will care about what you’re about to do, and tell the parasite to cease the annoyance. Your balls pop back to their normal stature, accompanied with what you’re certain is the Mimbrane equivalent of a disappointed huff.”}
Your [balls] are rubbing tantalizingly against your inner thighs. Your Mimbrane must be enjoying itself. 
A trickle of pre runs down your [leg]. Is your Mimbrane screwing around with your [balls], you wonder.
An unseen hand begins massaging your [balls]. It’s troubling at first and certainly makes it harder to walk, but you find it extremely comfortable. Your Mimbrane seems to enjoy just getting to do it judging by the soft chirps it makes from time to time.
Breasts Mimbrane: 
Your balance begins to become an obstacle as your gait resembles more of a stagger. Each step seems to be exaggerated to a rather large degree by your [breasts]. They sway and bounce as if gravity were little more than a dream. Judging by the odd little wiggling of your [nipples], you figure this must be the work of your Mimbrane. {Nice: “You ask the parasite to at least knock it down a few notches. The show is probably a fun one, but you would rather not get thrown off stage.”/Mischievous: “You continue on with the excessive chest swings and bounces, finding it amusing. Maybe you should try and keep track of the double takes you cause.”/Mean: “Maybe you should invest in some sort of titanium bra. You grasp the mounds and angrily whisper to them, demanding the parasite knock it off with your knockers.”}
{if dicknipples & lust ≥ 50 “Your [nipples] suddenly project their inner dicks, creating a {pair/trio/multitude} of tents in your {uppergarment}. For a moment you try to figure out what could be going on. When the chest-mounted cocks start to squeak and chirp, you know exactly what’s going on.”}
Every so often, your [breasts] will just bounce or shake of their own accord, a clear sign your Mimbrane is just having a good time.
For whatever reason, your [breasts] seem to be particularly perky and light no matter what size they seem to get. Perhaps your Mimbrane is responsible?
Hand Mimbrane: 
Your Mimbrane-covered hand starts to make groping gesture at nothing in particular. You aren’t entirely sure if it wants to get at some boobs or if you’ve just been making an impression on the parasite. At least it hasn’t started doing a jerk-off motion...
It isn’t doing much of anything, but just the sight of your Mimbrane’s tiny eyes and mouth on your palm is distracting. The parasite looks to be content with itself from what you can tell.
Your fingernails lately have looked particularly pristine as of late despite your lack of high-end maintenance. Is the Mimbrane responsible for your fine manicure?
Hands Mimbranes: 
Your Mimbrane-covered hands start to make groping gestures at nothing in particular. You aren’t entirely sure if they want to get at some boobs or if you’ve just been making an impression on the parasites. At least they haven’t started doing a jerk-off motion...
They aren’t doing much of anything, but just the sight of your Mimbranes’ tiny eyes and mouths on your palms is distracting. The parasites look to be content with themselves from what you can tell.
Your fingernails lately have looked particularly pristine as of late despite your lack of high-end maintenance. Are the Mimbranes responsible for your fine manicure?
Foot Mimbrane: 
You’re distracted by the odd little movements your Mimbrane-controlled [foot] is making. The parasite occasionally rubs your toes around, either seeming bored or enjoying interacting with its surroundings. You aren’t sure what’s worse.
A squeak escapes your [foot] with each step you take. A noisy Mimbrane appears to be having a goofy time of itself.
You’ve noticed that your toe nails have looked well-manicured for a while lately through no action of your own. Could your Mimbrane be responsible?
Feet Mimbranes: 
You’re distracted by the odd little movements your Mimbrane-controlled [feet] are making. The parasites occasionally rub your toes around, either seeming bored or enjoying interacting with their surroundings. You aren’t sure what’s worse.

You’ve noticed that your toe nails have looked well-manicured for a while lately through no action of your own. Could your Mimbranes be responsible?
Head Mimbrane: 
Your [lips] make kissing motions involuntarily, puckering and wavering at nothing. Thankfully, no one that matters seems to have noticed. You imagine your Mimbrane has taken an interest in you doing it yourself, probably attaching that motion to the passion that normally overtakes you. It’s probably a good idea to later describe to the parasite how opposite the effect is when you do it at nothing.
While going about your business, you suddenly start feeling your [hair] moving around and changing your haircut. Sadly there’s nothing nearby for you to get a look at what’s going on. Your Mimbrane must be fascinating itself with your hairdo. You ask it to at least put it back the way it found it when its done.
Occasionally your [lips] move on their own, mimicking various expressions. You aren’t quite sure why the Mimbrane is doing it, but you just let it have its fun so long as no one is watching.
You’ve noticed your [face] has looked particularly clean lately. Is the Mimbrane responsible? {Mischeivious “You wonder if there’s a business opportunity to be had here...”} 
Blocked Transformation/Removal
//Mimbranes can only be removed by doctor facilities and must be removed entirely rather than piecemeal. Mimbranes will block any attempts to remove their organ and in the case of feet, they will block transformation attempts away from human feet (as of this writing anyway). These scenes play to highlight that block. Scenes are included for body parts that presumably cannot be removed anyway.
Penis Mimbrane: The Mimbrane surrounding your [cock] suddenly bursts to life and squeezes your dick for all it’s worth. Seems the parasite’s efforts are keeping you from losing your cock entirely.
Vagina Mimbrane: A powerful stretching overtakes your [vagina], your Mimbrane doing everything in its power to keep the feminine canyon from vanishing. Seems you won’t be able to get rid of your pussy so long as the parasite is in control of it.
Ass Mimbrane: Your [asshole] gapes beyond your wildest imagination, cheeks flaring wide. Seems any attempt to seal your [ass] or otherwise rid your lower disposal hole is met with resistance by your butt-hugging Mimbrane.
Scrotum Mimbrane: A powerful tug around your [balls] keeps them from disappearing into your body. The Mimbrane encapsulating your [sack] seems poised to act against any attempts to fully remove your cum factories.
Breasts Mimbrane: Your [fullchest] pulls from your body with a tremendous force, resisting the attempt to flatten your girlish curves. The Mimbrane mounds refuse to be deflated, it seems.
Hand Mimbrane: You can’t get rid of your hands while a Mimbrane surrounds any of them.
Hands Mimbranes:  You can’t get rid of your hands while a Mimbrane surrounds them.
Foot Mimbrane: 
	Removal: Your [foot] clenches to an uncomfortable degree, refusing to be removed. The Mimbrane surrounding the extremity seems to counteract any attempts to remove its home.
	Transformation from human: Suddenly your toes flex and dig, showing faint signs of your impending transformation. The appearance subsides, however, and you’re left with your [foot]. With a heavy sigh, it would seem your Mimbrane refuses to give up the shape of your feet to whatever was in store for you before.

Head Mimbrane: Your Mimbrane refuses to let you get rid of your head you monster. You’ll have to find some other way to decapitate yourself.

Scenes
Victory over Mimbrane
Your adversary falls from the sky, too injured to combat any further. The Mimbrane can only pant uselessly on the ground, slowly extending its four corners to try and crawl away. {The parasite did manage to work you up into a bit of a frenzy. That slick skin could make for a halfway decent tension reliever.} 
Let it Go
The battered rag disappears into the wilderness to tend to its wounds. It’ll be quite some time before it can pester a traveler again.
Kill it
You make short work of the wounded parasite, discarding it somewhere out of sight. {if PC has Mimbrane}The Mimbrane(s) on you is(are) stone silent. You have little doubt that it(they) saw your act.{end}
//Any attached Mimbranes go down one trust level
Use it as a masturbation aid - Cock
You grab the fleeing parasite by one of its corners, holding it firmly with one hand as it meekly squirms and cries. The Mimbrane’s scent flows around you once you lift the creature up, smelling somewhat of strawberries and lube at first whiff. Your free hand examines its smooth, oily topside, fingers tingling upon contact. This ought to make a fine rag to relieve some of your pent-up pressure. What life is left in the parasite doesn’t seem to be enough for it present a threat anymore.
Juggling the floundering blanket between your hands, you eventually slip off your [armor] to reveal your naked form. You grasp the Mimbrane by its sides now, its miniscule face pointing skyward. Its as if you’re grasping onto a writhing terry cloth. Drawn out, desperate squeaks and chirps tumble through the jungle, anxious to find any passing ears. The little bugger isn’t entirely certain what you’re planning to do to it.
The Mimbrane’s struggle calms as you position the sentient sheet under your [cock], catching its attention. Though you’re certain the little guy lacks the strength to mend itself onto your cock, caution is never worth neglecting. {if cock Mimbrane already present “Would it even attempt to latch onto your already-claimed post?”} Special attention is made to ensure the slick glossy underside of the parasite never comes into contact with anything but your firm grip. Precautions in place, you’re left to tend to your pleasure pole, already erect and throbbing from just a few moments of it hanging in the thick must radiating from the Mimbrane.
You’re bowled over by a rather intense tingling the instant dick flesh rubs against the lubricious leech. The breeze of the forest suddenly feels more intense on your {skinadjective skin}. {Feet} dig into the dirt instinctively. Obviously, direct contact with the parasite’s main line of offense is stirring up your senses something fierce. You’re undeterred in your endeavour however. May as well strap in. 
The Mimbrane goes lax in your grasp, ready and willing to serve as your plaything. No doubt it’s hoping to get a nice consolation prize out of having the life bashed out of its flat hide. A flash of cool followed by radiating warmth seeps into your penis once you lay one end of the being’s sleek, red flesh on it. The tingling sensations seem to be intensifying as well; the odds of you backing off now have dwindled into little more than ash in your mind, singed by a power station revving to life around your manhood. 
An endless inward gasp is all you can manage as you wrap the Mimbrane around your [cock], overwhelmed by tingling, oily rapture. It feels like a lifetime and an instant before you finish the job. {if cock > 20 inches “Your proud, tall dick pokes out triumphantly from the wriggling tortilla you’ve created around it.”}{if cock < 7 inches “The top of your tall dick cocoon caves in a little, the parasite much more than adequate for encompassing your small member.”}{else “Your throbbing dick sits comfortably within the parasitic tortilla, air teasing your [cockhead] as it blows in and out the opening.”} For a few moments, you can only breathlessly revel in the lascivious jolts and vibrations the squirming cock cover is flooding you with.
The Mimbrane’s fulsome secretions ooze out of the bottom, soaking your base{have balls “ and trickling over your [sack]”}. Dry [skin] coming into contact with the sexy slime gets you stirring again and drags you back out of the mesmerizing haze you fell into. Your hands grasp the parasite’s underside; it isn’t nearly as soaking and slick as what’s entertaining your dick, but its certainly a little more to grasp than a buxom partner on a hot summer’s day. Your toy gets antsy under your grip, teasing your fingertips and massaging your palm while simultaneously tightening and rubbing your shaft.
As thrilling as the intoxicating massage is, this was supposed to be a domineering act of selfish intent! You claw your way back from the pits of sensuality to reassert the situation under your control. The parasite chirps timidly as your hold strengthens. An inhale solidifies your resolve. An exhale commits you to your fate. You push the creature up your [cock].
Your resolve is weary. Your commitment is slipping through your fingers. Merely sliding the pernicious sleeve up your length is tantamount to your crotch going on a year-long vacation through the inner reaches of some whore nebula. The sensual shock, the lustrous wanton desire seeping into your rod... You may as well have licked a frog. And then fucked its brains out. But this battle – this veritable round two – is of your own making, and you’ll be damned if you’ll succumb to something so carnal now. This jungle will bear witness to your successive success.
You pull the Mimbrane back down. The music of the wilderness bows to the thick, gooey sounds. {if cock >= 7 inches “Your [cockhead] feels alien to you once the top of your drowned cock erupts from the top of the parasite’s embrace.”} Holding the sleeve hard against your base only exposes more of your crotch to the dangerous liquid lust. With the push and pull thoroughly explored, you finally go to work. You stroke for the heavens. You tug for the underworld. Each motion sends out a wet squish that overpowers nature’s melody. 
The motion only picks up in pace as you continue. The war is waging between artificial and controlled ambitions. To think such pleasure lies in a mere chemical, one a creature thoughtlessly exudes. Somewhere in an unimportant corner of your mind you make a mental note to tread lightly when discovering the undiscovered. Especially when you discover by using your dick. 
The stroking is becoming involuntary now. At some point you fell to your back, [butt] digging into the ground as more of your body gets into the act. Even your [feet] are grasping at the ground in any way they can. Time fading in and out worries you; this is no way for a warrior to battle. Your macho bravado doesn’t really relish in the fact that you’ve consigned to dealing directly with a potent parasite. This fact is only further buried under the mounting torrent of release {within your balls }on the cusp of breaking free.
Each stroke only gets harder. Your [cock] twitches and convulses in preparation. The Mimbrane is unrelenting in its part: tickling your hands, massaging your member, releasing every last bit of moist craving directly into your [skin]. You assuredly would be releasing a cascade of pre, but there’s no distinguishing it from the vigorous slathering you and the parasite have coated your midsection in. 
Everything goes silent, your breath caught. {if dicknipples “Your [nipples] spit [cum] everywhere around you. ”}{if vagina “An ignored [pussy] relishes its own {meager/ample/plentiful} release of feminine fluids.”}{if balls “More than a few heads would turn at the sight of your [sack] clenching its damnedest, anxious for clemency.”} A [cumColor] {burst/fountain/downpour/torrential deluge} fills the air, piercing through the hazy clouds of sexual perspiration the parasite has emitted in your anxiety. The Mimbrane summons a sudden burst of strength timed with your orgasmic relinquishing of its body, unfurling itself from around your [cock] to stretch and catch as much [cumType] nutrition as it can handle.
Through your convulsions and the slight shock of your lust-soaked prick meeting the air again, you’re amazed by the parasite when it stretches to easily double its original surface area. The creature is essentially acting as a tarp, frantically moving around your lower half as it works to collect your [cum]. {Low CumQ “The act may be a little overzealous for what little your penis has to share, sadly. But you figure a battered creature has to make the most of any gift horse it comes across.”}{Average CumQ “Its actions are enough to contain your sizeable contribution. The parasite should have enough of your jism to last it a week or three.”}{High CumQ “The parasite is barely able to stretch large enough to catch your outrageous spasms of spunk. Your [cum] slides down the creature’s slick skin and collects in the center, creating a [cumType] pool in the middle of the parasitic blanket.”}{Too Much CumQ “There’s no lengths the parasite can stretch to that would allow it to properly contain your otherworldly discharge. The poor creature strains to move under the sheer weight of the [cumColor] volume its collected. It would happily consume all that it could not carry if it could, but its metabolism would prevent it from indulging for very long.”}
You watch the Mimbrane {Not Too Much CumQ “waddle off with its payload. The parasite takes precious care to maintain that which it cannot eat on the spot.”}{Too Much CumQ “struggle under its immense payload. The parasite’s forced to let off some of its [cumType] load just so it can begin to drag itself along the jungle floor.”} It’s an interesting sight to say the very least. Let no one say you aren’t a merciful conqueror.
Reclaiming your [armor], you realize that while you have satisfied your initial craving, your [cock] still tingles and twitches. No amount of rubbing it dry of the Mimbrane’s coating seems to be helping. Best you figure, <b>your actions are probably going to stir you up for a few hours.</b> Guess you can’t always play with fire without getting burned sometimes.
//Lust increases two points an hour for 10 hours.  
Defeated by Mimbrane
Beginning Defeated Text
The air around you feels so dense, so thick. Humidity chokes you. It’s become so hard to breathe. You can’t stop panting. Deep, healing breaths elude you, leaving you to your hyperventilation. Maybe if you strip off your [armor] it’ll be easier to settle down. So you do. But it doesn’t help. It’s only gotten worse. Your naked {flesh is/fur is/scales are} only more exposed.
[Legs] are getting weak. You lie down. The dirt isn’t helping. The grass doesn’t comfort. The shade may as well not exist. Any stray breeze is powerless. Your hands hopelessly grope around your body, uselessly caress you. All you can smell is that parasite. Its sweet, musty lust overpowers your senses, surrounding you in a heavy cloud. You’re confused, stuck between an agonizing rut and oppressive environment.
The Mimbrane waits for the aftermath of its deluge to paralyze you further. {if player has Mimbrane: “The Mimbrane already on you is unrelenting in its emissions.”}{if player has multiple Mimbranes: “The Mimbranes already on you are unrelenting in their emissions.”} You eventually do calm down to some degree, crushed under the artificial passion and salacious smog.

Get Penis Mimbrane
Your [cock] stands like a lighthouse to the troubled Mimbrane at sea, [cockhead] a shining beacon through the thick red fog. Its slick skin sliding along your [legs] breaks up your frenzied breathing with short gasps. The smooth, flat parasite quickly glides across your body to your pecker, inspecting it like a Christmas gift. The bow on top is a perk bead of pre which the creature quickly gulps down into its tiny mouth. The sensation of the miniscule feeding on your already-overburdened dick doesn’t help your fragile state. 
Its meager appetite satisfied, the parasite goes to work, sizing itself up to slightly overtake your [length] inches of masculinity. The Mimbrane hooks one of its four corners down around your base. The caress of its velvet underside on your delicates would send you to the edge had you not already tumbled over it. Its diminutive set of eyes and mouth fade into the parasite’s thin flesh and it quickly wraps itself around your turgid tower.
It doesn’t take long before your member is entirely covered. Where once a proud pecker stood tall now rests an odd, moist, light red cocoon. You don’t really get a good look at it, however. You’re much too preoccupied with the throes of ecstasy, heat, and humidity that are clouding your every thought. Things are only escalating now that your cock is in direct contact with what put you here in the first place.
Through the haze of confusion, you notice a new sensation on your penis. The Mimbrane is wiring itself to your nervous system. It doesn’t hurt - heaven only knows if you can actually feel anything currently and distinguish it as a real sensation. Your dick feels nebulous to you as the parasite does its magic, making you unsure of its shape or size in your mind’s eye. And then the sensations pass. You feel the hazy, tainted air on your crotch again. 
That’s when you calm down long enough to get a look at your dick. It’s a [cock], same as it was before. You examine it with your hands; it feels like nothing’s changed. Your [cockhead] looks as normal to you as it did mere moments bef– no. Something is off. Two odd, tiny little bumps are just north of your opening. Poking and prodding at them reveals nothing. You motion as if to squeeze one like a pimple, but the pain is extraordinary before you can so much as pinch. The instant your fingers lift off, however, the sensation disappears. 
Further examination reveals an extremely slight bulge running all the way around the base of your prick. Fingering at it feels as futile as peeling your own skin off. The parasite actually managed to bond itself onto your dick. Then it dawns on you: you aren’t just free of the sexual spasm from earlier. It actually feels as if you managed to knock your rocks off. But you have no memory of any sort of climax, nor do you recall even blacking out. {Low CumQ “By sheer chance, you run your hand up your side to find a rough little spot of dry [cum].”}{Average CumQ “That’s when you notice the dried [cum] around your body.”}{High CumQ “That’s when you spot evidence of your massive load on and around you. Small pools of [cum] still remain even.”}{Too Much CumQ “That’s when you start to really strain to remember as enormous pools of [cum] come into focus on and around you. How you failed to notice the plentiful [cumColor] evidence surrounding you, you’ll never know.”} Looks like the Mimbrane got to have its cake and eat it, too.
Not wanting to re-experience the mind-melting pain of trying to remove the faux flesh from your crotch, you resign to your fate as host. One last wistful glance down at your [cock] is all you pay, still wrapping your head around the ordeal. You feel the same as you did before you even ran into the creature. And you even almost look the same, save for those two miniscule blemishes on your [cockhead]. They’re barely noticeable, but they may as well be flashing lights to you. You gather your [armor] and head off, doing your best to get your mind off your new traveling companion.
Get Vagina Mimbrane
Your [cunt] sits as an unexplored chasm of wonder and merriment to the Mimbrane before you. The parasite brushes up between your legs to your feminine crevice. Its moist, smooth skin gently brushing up against your [skintype] thighs definitely doesn’t help your currently precarious mental state. A meager mouth teases you as it explores your folds, eager to lap up any fluids you may already have let free in your ecstasy.
Its paltry appetite sated, the Mimbrane goes to work smothering your groin, tiny face – or what meager options it has to constitute a face – sinking into the thin sheet. Excited gasps muscle in through your panting when your [clit] is stimulated beyond belief. The sheet covers little else beyond your snatch, uninterested in serving double duty as a sentient bikini. You can feel it shift and push its way into every part of your cooch. Every detail - every opening - is coated in parasitic paint, as it were.
The Mimbrane splits itself to accommodate your own fissure, mimicking its every facet. In your throes of wanton desire and uncomfortable tension, you can’t even discern just how far into your box the creature goes. What do you do feel, though, is the parasite mending into your nervous system. There is no pain; only mounting confusion at the mixed messages coming from both your nerve endings and your <i>new</i> nerve endings. For a moment, you can’t picture your pussy. A nebulous region exists in its place, one where a clit is as familiar as a deity’s true intentions. 
Then nothing. Well, you feel normal. Suddenly you’re fine, albeit laying naked on the jungle floor. Your hands rush to investigate your [pussy], eager to find something amiss. But its the same as before you ran into that blanket with a grudge. 
No... Further examination clues you in on a new development. Two, in fact. A pair of tiny little bumps sit just above your pussy. You get no response from pressing and prodding at them. But the instant you try and squeeze one of them, a debilitating pain blasts through you, lasting only as long as your fingers are poised to squeeze the blemish. The second they’re free is the second you feel fine again. That’s when you clue in on the barely-discernable lump of flesh outlining a little ways around your vagina. You try and work your way around it, but it feels as if you were trying to pry open a wrinkle. 
Another revelation dawns on you: not only are you free of the artificially-induced desire the parasite thrusted upon you during your fight, but you feel completely sated of any sexual passion. But you don’t recall experiencing the delightful climax that typically precludes how you feel now. Did it happen at all? It feels slightly wet between your legs, but now you aren’t even sure if that’s just your head making excuses.
You decide it better to just gather your [armor] and move on. Whether or not you climaxed (and can remember it if you did) is secondary to worrying about your latest involuntary traveling companion. 
Get Ass Mimbrane
{Is genderless “The barren tract of land across your crotch doesn’t exactly thrill the parasite. The”}{Has cock Mimbrane “With your [cock] already claimed, the”}{Has vagina Mimbrane “With your [pussy] already claimed, the”}{Has cock and vagina Mimbrane “With both your [cock] and [pussy] already claimed, the”} Mimbrane sets its tiny sights on your hind quarters. One would assume the little guy wouldn’t make it much farther than your [hips] laying on your back the way you are. But assumptions with alien lifeforms are typically dangerous to make.
Your exaggerated panting gets interrupted by surprised gasps as the slick sheet forces itself in between the ground and your [ass]. The parasite would likely have little trouble encompassing your posterior in this position, but your lust-addled mind involuntarily reacts to the wedging as a sign to flip over. You aren’t thinking straight enough to realize that pointing your bottom skyward may be to your disadvantage. 
The Mimbrane, however, is ecstatic with its endeavour being made that much easier. The creature scrambles atop your duo of hills only to find that first it must play janitor. It slides and sweeps over your [skintone skindescription], removing any of evidence of the jungle from its new home. You feel as if someone is sensually massaging your ass with a wet silk rag. It goes on for several minutes, long enough for you to start digging your hands into the ground to deal with the unrelenting turmoil.
Its job complete, the parasite wastes no more time in draping itself atop your [ass], sealing to its every detail. The sentient rag worms its way into your crack and within your [asshole]. It isn’t long before your butt is completely smothered, Mimbrane stretched to easily embrace your {average/hefty/expansive/titanic} trunk. Next, the creature weaves itself into your nervous system, confusing you further as your mind is unable to discern between genuine and relayed feelings. You absentmindedly try and clench your pucker, but get no response. One moment you feel tight, the next moment you feel as if your asshole was a gaping crater.
Then you’re relaxed. The sounds of the jungle drag you back from whatever trance you were under. With your wits again on your side, your hands race to your backside, anxious to find anything amiss. All it seems you’re doing is groping your [ass], though. You even go so far as to finger your [asshole], afraid to come across something untoward. Still nothing. 
But just as you think all is normal, your hands brush past a couple of tiny bumps sitting smack center above your rear crevice. Manhandling them a little yields no response, but a devastating pain bowls you over the instant you even attempt to squeeze them. The injury doesn’t linger, however. Continuing to brush over the lumps reveals an ever-so-slight ascension of your [skin]. The light seam runs all around outside the perimeter of your ass and up your [hips]. You think you can see it, but it’s hardly noticeable. There’s definitely no way for you to pry it, an action as easy as scraping at your own [skin]. 
Its obvious that the Mimbrane got its prize: an ample pair of cheeks with a hole hidden in between them. You aren’t quite sure how you managed to miss the elation that typically comes with the relief of ridding yourself of sexual tension, but it isn’t a concern that lingers long. You gather your [armor] and set out, lingering between worry and curiosity as to what will come of your posterior parasite.
Get Scrotum Mimbrane 
Despite your suffering, you can’t help but stutter out a curse to no one, frustrated to succumb to yet another of the blanket-looking parasites. Your [cock] springs to life, moving on its own and frantically chirping to your conqueror. Seems as though the Mimbrane member has prime real estate scoped out for its new friend. You desperately want to reach out and grasp onto your puppeted meat, the parasite’s movement only furthering your sexual hysteria, but you’re oddly paralyzed by the thick, humid smog of lust that lingers from your battle. You can only cast a weary gaze on the {cocktype} shaft, still coated in the Mimbrane’s secretions and glimmering in the light.
The victor heeds the friendly cries of your cock and crawls up your [legs] towards it. Despite the amped blood flow stiffening your dick, the raging erection is able to bend enough to greet its compatriot in some manner of face-to-face contact. The two cease any remaining pleasantries and get down to brass tacks as the new Mimbrane grasps onto your cock with a couple of its corners and stuffs its miniscule face atop your [cockhead]. Your meat obliges with a steady stream of pre which the parasite anxiously laps down.
Your pole acting on its own coupled with the warm, slick parasite enjoying itself makes it all the worse that you can’t seem to organize any voluntary muscle movement. The most coherent urge you can fathom is just wanting to press your aggressor up against your [cock] and rub one out to satiate your pent-up urges. Sadly, it’s taking the same amount of effort just to close your mouth for a second when your panting dries it out. The stuffy, oppressive cloud of craving surrounding you is just too strong.
Meager appetite full, the Mimbrane enjoys a few more unintelligible chirps and squeaks with your cock before it backs off. Its attention focuses squarely on your [balls]. Once you feel the parasite cup itself around them it becomes all too clear just what it and its friend had to talk about. Familiar sensations of smothering and crossed nerves flood you yet again, a sign that the parasite is merging onto your [sack]. The manhandling of your jewels as the sheet works its way around them only furthers your craving to tend to their payload.
You re-experience the nebulous feeling that accompanies the integration of a Mimbrane into your nervous system. Unable to peer your head up at the action, your inner perception of your sack fluctuates like a boat caught atop a nervous ocean. And – just as before – you suddenly feel fine. The humidity vanishes, your lust subsides, and your [balls] look as they did before. You know better at this point, though, quickly discovering the pair of meager lumps disguising the Mimbrane’s eyes sitting front and center on your coin purse.
What you hadn’t expected was a third, slightly larger bump sitting below and between them. Without an orifice to re-appropriate as its own, it would seem that the Mimbrane has maintained its mouth. So you assume, anyway. Neither of your parasitic pals seem all that interested in blowing their covers to you at the moment as it is. You gather your [armor] and set off, eager to explore this mystery further at a later time.
Get Breasts Mimbrane 
Through the uncomfortable humidity and insatiable sex drive, a tiny voice far back in your head ponders to itself. Falling victim to yet another Mimbrane makes it question whether or not you even tried to get around this. But the voice fucks off into a forgotten oblivion, hushed by your agony and desire to know just where the next contestant will wind up. After exchanging pleasantries with your appropriated body parts, the parasite glides along your body until its right atop your [fullchest]. No hint of hesitation lies in the creature.
You’re granted a short stare from your conqueror while its body stretches to encompass {both/all} of your jiggling {hilltops/mountains/planets}. You can’t get a good read on what it’s thinking, but you’re certain that there is some train of thought going on in there. Any breakthroughs into a sentient parasite’s inner machinations vanish as quickly as the creature’s face once it sinks back into the wriggling sheet. 
There’s a desperate inclination to at least run your hands along the glistening topside of the fiend. The thought of rubbing the oily pseudo-cloth across your torso isn’t enough to break free of the stuffy eroticism that pins you to the jungle floor. The form of your chest bumps are clearly visible now, the Mimbrane sealing its form over yours. You have a much nicer vantage point of the parasite’s handiwork now that its right in front of you. Replicas of your [nipples] form along its surface. The creature easily slides itself over every square inch of breast flesh.
A moist pink replica of your chest is all that remains of the Mimbrane. You can’t admire it for too long before the familiar tinge of the creature weaving its way into your nervous system seeps into your mind. Again you feel the unusual, nebulous sensation of not exactly having a grasp on what form your body’s in. But through squinted eyes covered in sweat, you can make out the wobbling silhouette of your [breasts]. They’re still there. But things feel off.
Then everything’s back to normal. Did you black out or something? The instantaneous ending of the multiple sensations and urges and feelings wracking away at you is just as jarring and out of place as it always is. From your point of view, its as if everything just happened in less time than the blink of an eye. But by now you’re certain there’s more to it.
Your next course of action is to examine your chest to try and find where the Mimbrane is hiding its eyes. The first assumption is around one of your [nipples], but you don’t discover anything new. It takes a little bit of fondling before you find the two little lumps square center above your cleavage. Guess nature just can’t resist symmetry. You also miss the practically invisible bulge of [skin] running around the perimeter of your knockers, presumably marking where the parasite ends and you begin. As always, its easy to miss and you have no hope of prying the thing off of you.
You gather up your [armor] and head off with the new addition to your close family.
Get Hands Mimbranes 
//First hand
Your conqueror is actually a little confused. All of its prime targets have been taken! But it would seem that your parasitic attachments are doing their damnedest to keep their friend from being discouraged. The constant movement and noise around your body struggles against the haze that’s locked you into a stuffy bout of sensual passion. Trying to stay current on the Mimbrane’s actions is proving to be a difficult ordeal.
That’s when a slick, smooth touch of your palm garners your attention. The parasite is prodding at your hand, seemingly examining it. Though you lack the coherence to whip your arm away, you’re at least able to clench your fingers. Your grip isn’t quite up to your full potential, but you do manage to snag the Mimbrane’s inquisitive corner. It doesn’t startle the creature, however, much to your disappointment. If anything, the direct contact with the parasite’s oily top side is only making your inner turmoil worse.
No, instead the Mimbrane casually wraps the rest of its body around your weak fist. You make a weak gesture, relinquishing your grapple to try and move your fingers in some useless attempt to escape the parasite. All you manage to do is make it easier for it to work its way around your digits and onto your palm. Falling back to making another fist is your final recourse, unable to move or react intelligibly enough to effectively defend yourself.
The gesture proves meaningless, and soon it appears you’ve found yourself a wriggling glove of sorts, grasped firmly onto your wrist. Next comes the recognizable sensation of the Mimbrane integrating into your nervous system. Though you can’t get a coherent feeling from them, you can at least still move your fingers. Soon, the moist, warm feeling of entrapment is replaced with the comparatively cool breeze of the jungle.
You’ve gotten rather used to this process by now. The jolt of normalcy isn’t even a shock anymore. The hunt for the creature’s eyes and mouth doesn’t even take long; a triage of tiny bumps lay concealed square center on your [skincolor] palm. You rub your other thumb over them, a tad surprised to see how much durable the typically sensitive additions are. You suppose the Mimbrane has a grasp on what a hand actually is and has modified itself accordingly.
As you reach over for your [armor], anxious to keep moving, something dawns on you. You run your thumb back over the parasitic palm again. Its actually moist. But this isn’t the remnants of your opponent. It looks like {cum/girl spunk/it came from you}. Maybe you aren’t quite through wondering just what goes on when a Mimbrane couples onto its prey...
//Second hand
It’s a Mimbrane soiree and everyone’s invited! You think you said that out loud, but honestly aren’t sure. You’ve fallen victim to these parasites enough times now to start speculating whether or not you’re even trying anymore. Maybe you enjoy it. Maybe it’s really hard for you to resist them when they start sweating and attacking you uncontrollably. Maybe nurturing these creatures is some sort of penance for your father’s sins. Maybe you’ve been suffering from a series of bad days that just so happen to coincide with every moment you run into a Mimbrane.
...It’s hard being introspective when you’re hornier than a cactus and stuffier than a sauna.
The creature brushes up against your other hand, the one free of parasitic control. You had a good feeling that was where it would wind up.
You don’t even bother looking at it – trying to pierce through the haze that’s pinned you down to fight it off. Did your other hand just direct it or something? Who knows. The Mimbranes always seem to get riled up when they run into a new roommate. Experiencing various parts of your body acting of their own accord has become second nature to you by now.
You can’t feel your hand anymore. The parasite must have already smothered your other hand and has moved onto that integration. Does it turn you on still? Maybe. It’s hard to say. It probably would have been faster had you just gone limp the instant the damn thing fell out of the sky at you. 
Seems like you’ve got a bit of angry lust for no good reason. Or you’re frustrated. Or just confused. Or– oh, things are back to normal. That same normal you’ve run into {number of Mimbranes on the PC including the new hand: three/four/five/six/seven} times now. You look down at hand; three bumps are arranged on your palm same as they are on your other one.
With your wits back with you, a heavy sigh accompanies the gathering of your [armor]. Best not to dwell on this further.
Get Feet Mimbranes 
//First foot
...
Again! You’ve succumbed again! Your body is covered in these things! Where will this Mimbrane go? Do you even care? 
You’ve honed the retreating back to your subconscious into an art at this point. Anything to escape the repeated anguish these Mimbranes throw you under. You can barely even feel the parasites manipulating your body in all sorts of strange and unnatural ways. Its the same as always, you figure. 
You’ve given up trying to figure out why you keep losing to what amounts to a rag in the wind. You can’t concentrate immediately after the fact, and when the parasite’s on you, you’re done caring. Are you even frustrated anymore? When something becomes so commonplace, can someone continue to act surprised?
The commotion calms down, leaving only your labored panting to your ears. A moist, deft touch lands on your [foot], snapping you out of the odd bout of self-pity. You can’t get a good view over your struggling [fullchest], but it would appear the parasite has opted to attach itself to your foot. Oily coverings weave their way between your toes, along your arch and up your ankle. As always, little time transpires before your extremity is sealed within the creature’s undulating, form-fitting grip.
You cease paying attention to the little thing once the familiar feeling of it weaving its way into your nervous system kicks in. The sensation of forgetting how your body part is constructed is old hat, no matter how bizarre it feels each time. It’ll be over soon anyway; may as well try and focus on something beyond the excruciating humidity and torrents of desire...
...Usually it can be difficult to get even the vaguest semblance of a clear head when you’re thrown into a rut like this. Sure, your body still feels like it wants to penetrate and be penetrated and do anything else it can to get through these anxious times. But here, safe in your mind, you’ve gotten better at at least not <i>thinking</i> like a psychopathic pervert. Maybe the repetition of being artificially driven to want to bang something isn’t doing as well of a job as it once did?
Any further exploration into the topic flutters away the instant things return to – you guessed it – normal. The normal always hits you like an oncoming car out of nowhere. The normal is always the anticlimax that leaves you feeling refreshed and unfulfilled. The normal is getting to be frustratingly abnormal. 
Your idle thoughts are getting to be noxious, you fear. You instead think to grasp your [foot] in your hand, curious to hunt down the three bumps at the bottom of the cereal box. The two eye bumps are easy enough to find centered right above your middle toe – you’ve gotten good at this, sadly. But the third tiny bulge is actually hidden underneath that same toe. Another instance of symmetry, you figure; the Mimbranes just must be naturally attracted to it.
You begin to start getting anxious over when your other foot will find its counterpart parasite, but perish the thought before it can germinate. There’s enough on your plate already with your {number of Mimbranes on the PC including the new foot: three/four/five/six/seven/eight} additional mouths to feed. You take your [armor] and go.
//Second Foot
You don’t even know if your body is your own anymore. Not when this happens, anyway. Everything under Mimbrane control is having a picnic greeting the latest arrival to Casa De La [Name]. Its the same as always. You know it’ll go to your free foot. Better to just put it all of your head and wait for “normal.”
Staring up through the pink haze surrounding you is the jungle canopy. Tall trees wobble lightly in the breeze. Scant beams of {moonlight/sunlight} burst their way in through the brush. Nature is oblivious to your plight.
The Mimbrane wraps around your [foot].
There don’t seem to be very many other signs of wildlife around at the moment. The involuntary movement of your body paired with the unusual sounds produced by the Mimbranes must be keeping them at bay. It’s too bad; now would be the perfect time for a little birdwatching.
The Mimbrane weaves into your nervous system.
It’s so hot. It’s always hot when you lose to these things. But when you’re absorbing nature like this, it’s hard to ignore every facet of it, regardless of how it came about. Sure, the lust fog surrounding you weighs on you like a steaming bag of bricks, but it isn’t like the jungle is that much better typically. How many creatures must love living here, you wonder. {If met the pitcher plants “Do the venus pitchers get much catches out in the middle of nowhere like this? ”}
You can’t feel your [foot].
Maybe if it were winter it wouldn’t be as uncomfortable around here. Surely most of the unsavory types wouldn’t enjoy even a slight drop in temperatures. It’s doubtful that the seasons make much of a difference around here, though, you figure. That seems to be how jungles usually work, right? Maybe it was foolish to imagine otherwise.
Things are back to normal.
That’s it. Panting’s gone. Your desire to fuck something is back to your more sustainable levels. Jungle feels like its typical self. You don’t even bother examining your new parasite. There’s no need. You’ve already gotten used to feeding a foot, as it were. Same as the rest of your body. This is common practice for you at this point.
You take your [armor] and go, refusing to dwell on what transpired. 
Get Head Mimbrane 
//Requires all attached Mimbranes be minimum level 2 trust
It’s as routine as morning wood. You’re flat on your back, panting your brains out, covered in parasitic sweat contending with your own. The sound of the Mimbranes all around your body happily conversing with one another and the new arrival is as loud as ever. You don’t pay the creatures much mind as they manipulate your paralyzed body; its easier to just wait out for “normal” to drop in when you’re blissfully ignorant of the stress. For once, not a hint of concern has penetrated your mind. Though the body may be unable to resist the attack of the parasites, your mind has learned how to deal with the dilemma.
Nature seems especially interesting again today. The pink haze isn’t as thick as usual, giving you a clearer sight at the Mimbrane hovering over your face.
Wait. What?
Your mind is dragged back to reality. You’re fully aware again, right in the moment. The odd sensation of being watched by a multitude of eyes is upon you. But nothing is more apparent than the Mimbrane staring you right in the eyes. The parasite’s front two corners are perched on the sides of your face, letting the creature suspend the best representation it has of a face a good distances above yours. Your labored breathing pushes the parasite a little with each exhale and sucks in a little of its haze with each inhale.
What does it intend to do? Have the number of Mimbranes gotten high enough for them to claim dominance over your body? You start to worry, but the look in the Mimbrane’s face is inquisitive. It’s as if its waiting for a response. The parasite taps on your [face] again, tracing your [lips] with one of its corners while chirping lightly at you. There’s no way in hell your microsurgeons can translate that for you...
That’s when you recall the codex! Mimbrane naturally avoid the face, instinctively afraid that a position anywhere near a host’s sensitive head will spell doom for them. This one seems reluctant to break that inbred habit. So then what is it doing? 
You think for a moment, eyes darting around your close-up champion, its face tilted to one side to only further appear as if awaiting a response. The rest of the Mimbranes on your body seem to think you’re alright... Perhaps they goaded this one into testing its luck? That would explain the tense feeling you’re getting about being watched. But rather than just go whole hog on your head, it would seem this parasite at least wants to try and get approval from you before working against its instincts.
It makes sense to you anyway. 
Its been awhile since you haven’t abandoned your body when its in a state like this. Shuddering from the humidity and thrust-upon lust from these parasites. Getting words out proves to be difficult. Through numerous stutters, pants and restarts, you ask the parasite cautiously perched atop you if it wants on your head. The Mimbrane moves in a fashion that appears to be nodding. But it continues staring at you.
Looks like the decision is up to you.
[Go ahead][No!]
[No!]
You’re wary of letting the Mimbrane cover your head, unsure how this final measure would pan out for you. You’re at least compelled to spit out an apology with your decline. It’s weird to have some hint of conversation with what you figured was just an animal.
The parasite scoots backwards from you, talking amongst your puppeted body parts. You think its disappointed, but there’s really no way to tell. Especially not when you’re feeling as horny and norma– 
Normal. Normal’s burst back onto the scene. It’s a bit more of a shock this time. Your conqueror has vanished and your body is pre-savaged. You double check your head to make sure the parasite didn’t get on it. There aren’t any unusual bumps or sensations. The assumption was that the blink from rut to right was a byproduct of a Mimbrane latching onto you. Now you don’t know what to think again.
The question simmers while you gather your [armor] and leave.
[Go ahead!]
Whether it’s because you’re feeling adventurous or just succumbing to the rut you thought you had become accustomed to, no one can say. But you nod your head to the anxious Mimbrane, stuttering out a labored “Sure.” The parasite exchanges a few more unintelligible squeaks with its cohorts, possibly to confirm what it’s about to do. Then it smothers your [face], forcing you to react by slamming your eyes shut. 
Smooth, slick skin wraps all around your head. Its as if someone were wrapping a hot, wet towel around your head. Your involuntary panting strains at finding air, instead sucking wet flesh into your mouth and nose. Warm waves meld to your every contour, encasing your head completely in short time. Just as panic begins to sinks in, the fleshy cocoon splits open at your orifices, prompting a deep gasp. The Mimbrane is over your lips and fades seamlessly into your mouth. It’s hard to tell where it ends anywhere the parasite has penetrated your head. You try and open your eyes as well, but are less successful in that endeavour; your eyelids refuse to move.
The electrifying sensation of the creature weaving its way into your nervous system is next. Your reaction would be to grasp your melon with your hands, but the extremities feel as if they’re under an immense weight. It’s no easier to move now than it ever has been any other time you lost to a Mimbrane. 
The sensation of not feeling your head is confusing. The smothered, moist titillation is more intense than what you experienced for any other bonding to your body, and now it’s competing with signals telling your brain the comparatively cool air is breezing past your skin. Your eyelids suddenly obey, and your head settles back its normal sensation.
Normal.
{if cock}But you’re still panting. Still horny. Still hot, still paralyzed, still confused. This is anything but normal now! Not snapping free of this hell is the most abnormal thing ever in this process that you had once thought you had become so accustomed to. Now what?
The light red haze crushing you starts to dissipate. Actually...it seems to be sucking into you. More accurately, the Mimbranes are absorbing it! Your whole body feels as if its taking in a deep breath, somehow. Soon, the cloud is clear, and with it goes the boiling humidity! That’s one nuisance down. The next is your searing libido, aching for release. What would be the best way to take care of that?
Your rock-hard [cock] knows, apparently; it’s stroking itself! The Mimbrane member is standing at full attention, skin applying pressure in vertical waves. From base to tip and back, going from tinge to more than a hand could grasp, each stroke is unique. The parasite is working your cock with pinpoint precision. There’s little preamble to be had; by now it knows your penis down to the last square nanometer. [Cum] {spurts/bursts/blasts/unnaturally explodes} forth. 
Typically your body would be getting into the act, but your back doesn’t even get the chance to arch. Your hands – controlled by their own Mimbrane coverings – bolt for the [cumcolor] fountain. Fingers rigid as steel work to contain the fruit of your loins in the general vicinity, strangely enough. It appears as if they don’t want to waste any of the precious cargo to the surrounding wilderness. By the time they’re – and consequently you – finished, the majority of your jism is strewn about your midsection and torso.
Your body goes into a sudden uproar of noisy squeaks and chirps! Your [lips] move on their own as well, reminding you of the latest addition to your merry band. Indeed, the skin around your head feels as if it were wriggling about ever so slightly, making for a rather peculiar experience. Seems everyone is amped to be fed, and your puppeted hands are happy to oblige. Smatterings of [cum] are distributed around you, smeared anywhere a Mimbrane mouth may be.
There’s a hypothesis to be had here. Though you can’t entirely explain it, it would seem that your jolt to “normalcy” was the period in which your aggressors would feed on your liquid lust. Mimbranes naturally act in methods that preserve their secrecy on a host. When someone loses to one of the parasites, it becomes easy to simply overwhelm them in the parasite’s natural funk. A momentary lapse in consciousness doesn’t seem all that farfetched when one is already sweaty, hot and suffering from sexual yearning beyond perceivable belief.
But the Mimbrane that “<i>asked</i>” to attach itself to your head must be a sign that the collective trusts you. Their confidence in you is strong enough that they can overcome their instinct to knock you out and instead let you experience their feeding frenzy. “Frenzy” is how it feels, too, with your body acting on the whims and volitions of its puppet masters. A duo of fingers deliver a dollop of [cumTemp] sustinence to your eager [lips]. The [cumFlavor] flavor is lost to you, however; the morsel is absorbed into your lips, which squeek happily in thanks.
The Mimbranes satiated, they begin to calm down. Though they’re incapable of wrestling away complete control of your body from you, awe was enough to render you essentially paralyzed up until this point. You touch your fingers to your lips, finding no trace of their treat. But they do suddenly kiss your tender touch, forcing a breathless laugh out of you. Digits return to find a duo of small bumps right above your upper lip. You weren’t going to be completely satisfied until you found those eyes...
A veil of complacency has been lifted this day. The Mimbranes certainly seem content, and you even got a peek into some of their more rare tendencies. Sure, they may be driven to feed and survive more than anything – heaven forbid anyone hear about how fast they jerked one out of you – but there seems to be some semblance of companionship in the faux skin.
Rejuvenated, you gather your [armor] and venture forth a bit happier than you were before.

Your [pussy] knows, apparently; it’s going crazy! The Mimbrane folds are exciting themselves into a soaked frenzy. Even your [clit] is stimulating itself, flesh pushing and teasing the love button with exacting precision. The parasite knows itself – and by extension you – down to seemingly every last cell. A {splash/wave/torrent} of femspunk gushes out your gash.
Typically your body would be getting into the act, but your back doesn’t even get the chance to arch. Your hands – controlled by their own Mimbrane coverings – bolt for the feminine fountain.

{else}
And that’s that. Suddenly, you’re returned to that tranquil yet jarring peace that you’ve become oh-so-accustomed to. Though something bothers you this time. For no fathomable reason, it feels as if you missed out on something. You dwell on that thought for a moment, but nothing more substantial roots. Maybe you’re imagining things.
You put your fingers to your mouth, surprised when your [lips] suddenly kiss them! Seems the Mimbrane on your face is quite content, and isn’t anxious to hide away from you quite so soon. A breathless laugh escapes you, taken aback by the cute little show of affection. Fingers return and find a couple of little bumps just above your upper lip. You weren’t going to be leaving before you knew where those eyes were, after all.
Rejuvenated, you gather your [armor] and venture forth a bit happier than you were before.
No Room for Mimbrane 
Much to the Mimbrane’s chagrin, it seems there’s simply no room for it on your body! You’re hoping it’ll leave so you can at least get out of its humid, paralyzing cloud of insidious behavior, but it seems to be talking again to your Mimbranes. You wonder what it–
...It’s gone. So is any inkling of sexual fervor. You glance around a little, surprised by the relative peace that’s attacked you out of nowhere. you snatch up your [armor] and get on your way before the parasite decides to get creative!

An odd sensation accompanied by cheerful chirping seems to be coming from your {Level 3 Mimbrane body part}. Upon investigation, you discover the parasite has made itself sweat. But this isn’t your normal perspiration, this is oily and sweet to the nose. This is the Mimbrane’s natural lust-inducing sweat!
It seems the parasite is fond enough of you that the little thing is comfortable letting some of its sugary, slightly-red ooze coat your body. The sweat tingles to the touch, turning you on somewhat as time goes on. It doesn’t seem to be nearly as volatile to you as it did when you were under attack by the Mimbrane. Perhaps you could use this against your enemies?
Before you can consider any further applications of your newfound slickness, the Mimbrane stops pumping its sexual syrup. It squeaks again... Looks like the parasite’s leaving it up to you whether or not you’d like to start coating your body in its sweet sweat.

Feeding time’s come early to the {ship name}. Your [cock] is ready for some manual milking, dribbling a little [cumColor] pre to help things along. You talk a little to your parasite{parasites}, cluing them in to your actions working for {its/their} favor as opposed to just another extraneous act of self-pleasure. It seems to do the trick; {your body seems/parts of your body seem} to be trembling a bit in anticipation. Removing your [armor] is essentially the alert to get ready.
If ever there were a time to dust off a handy “master masturbation” joke, now would be the time. Rare is the individual that can overcome your sexual savvy, and you’re just as proficient at getting what you want out of yourself. A deft touch and skilled stroke works out some [cumtype] gold from your well in record time. {If above average cum production “It isn’t quite up to your typical standards of production, but let no one say you aren’t conservative when necessary.”} Few would cotton to that as an accomplishment, but you aren’t choking the chicken for the pleasure today. 
No one worth worrying about is watching you anyway.
{Penis Mimbrane}Your [cock] has little trouble helping itself to its own creation. You can feel the inner rim of your urethra become remarkably sensitive. [CumTemp] jism is seeping right into your tip. It’s indescribable; the sensation of your [cockhead] moving of its own accord will never be something you can truly get accustomed to. The Mimbrane member gets its meager fill in just a few seconds, rejuvenation coursing down through the fiber of your rod. 
{Hand Mimbrane}A five-fingered bandit uses its prime location to go right for the [cumColor] goodness. Indeed, the Mimbrane-controlled hand forces an open palm to your [cockhead] like a thirsty spirit to an inviting spigot on a blazing summer’s day. It’s one thing to watch the miniature mouthfuls disappear into the unseen parasite’s gullet. It’s an entirely different thing to feel it. Each gulp pulses through your extremity as if it were being cleansed. Your fingertips waver a little as the creature finishes its meal, a sign that its undeniably satiated no doubt.
{Both Hand Mimbranes}A flurry of ten fingers work their way in towards your [cockhead], eager to sample your latest batch. For a moment you’re worried a fight could break out between ol’ Leftie and Righty, but instead the parasites intertwine your digits. Figures. You’ve never known the creatures to really compete in any fashion. Your conjoined palms hover just above and around your prick, allowing for both tiny mouths to get at the action. Each of their miniature gulps is a cleansing pulse that flies through your extremities and seemingly out your tips. Those tips gently rapping against your knuckles assures you that the sensation isn’t only in your head.
{Pussy Mimbrane}Two helpful fingers deliver a healthy dollop of cum south to an anxious [pussy]. The Mimbrane maw can hardly contain itself, your labia feeling as though it’s tugging at you just to get closer to your descending digits. Your pussy sucks on your fingers, absorbing the [cumFlavor] treat into its feminine flesh. It’s a bizarre experience every time that you may never be able to just get completely adjusted to. The reinvigoration that pulses through your gentials more than makes up for it, though.
{Ass Mimbrane}Your [ass] spreads its cheeks wide once you reach around to deliver the Mimbrane its treat, giving you pause. The rear-mounted parasite has always seemed overly enthusiastic – perhaps more than you’d like at times like this. Your [asshole] is loose and inviting, practically panting like a dog at dinnertime. It’s admittedly a little cute even if you’d rather never admit to it. The second your [cumColor]-colored fingers get close to your pucker, however, your buttocks spring down on them like a trap. The parasite savors its catch, absorbing every last drop right into its excited starfish. The Mimbrane releases your hand once satisfied, which you yank back with gusto. Maybe cute isn’t the word you’d use again...
{Scrotum Mimbrane}A little [cumFlavor] savoriness runs down the length of your [cock], much to the satisfaction of your [sack]. The Mimbrane stares up the savory morsel, keen on its arrival. But it slows to a stop just short of the parasite’s hungry maw. The creature desperately manipulates your [balls], trying to coerce the liquid down the remaining homestretch. Unable to ignore its plight – the undulating and determined stretching of the creature’s mouth was actually quite alarming – you push the [cum] down into the parasite’s happy mouth. It gives you an affectionate suck before you can draw your fingers back up.
{Breast Mimbrane}Your [fullchest] jiggle with excitement as [cum]-soaked fingers draw their way. The Mimbrane mounds seem to want to burst from your chest just to get closer to the [cumFlavor] feast. You press your hands against your [nipples], sighing at the strangely pleasant suckling against your digits. {if nipplecunts or lipples “You’re almost worried your hands will get sucked right in.”} Breastflesh massages against your grasp. The parasite has essentially turned the tables on typical breast features, groping and nursing in the reserve direction. Not that you mind so much when it still feels just as nice.
{Foot Mimbrane}Wiggling toes alert you to your hungry [foot] or more appropriately your hungry Mimbrane. You bend your [leg] to bring the parasite closer, getting a clear view of its hungry maw hiding underneath your digits. A finger’s worth of [cum] is plenty for the meager appetite. Toes curl around you once the offerings in place. Luckily, the angle keeps the parasite from any meaningful grip. It thanks you with a happy chirp, but the pleasurable sensation sinking through your foot with each of its tiny gulps is thanks enough.
{Both Feet Mimbranes}Your [feet] wiggle their toes anxiously. The Mimbranes are afraid you’d have forgotten them down south. Involuntary body movement isn’t easy to overlook, though. You bend both [legs] to draw the parasites in closer while dipping your fingers in [cum]. Your digits part ways to reveal both parasites’ maws, eager to down their [cumFlavor] treat. Their angles keep the creatures from grasping your fingers with their toes, but they at least try and pet you in some bizarre show of affection. The gesture isn’t lost on you, nor is their thankful chirp.
{Head Mimbrane}Trembling along your [face] lets you know that your head-mounted Mimbrane is ready and raring to partake from your [cumFlavor] handout. Your [lips] pull against you, squeaking quietly like a kitten wanting every last ounce of its mother’s attention. It’s a blessing the parasite doesn’t have control over your entire mouth; it’d probably be lashing out with your tongue, too. You bring the [cum]-soaked tip of your finger up to your mouth. The Mimbrane puckers your lips, not wanting to suffer through your slow approach. It feels as if you were applying lipstick for a moment, but the overwhelming sensation of your cum soaking into your skin dashes that relation in short order. Instead your face feels tingly and reinvigorated. 
With {your Mimbrane/both Mimbranes/all of your Mimbranes} satisfied, you retrieve your [armor] and go back to something a little more self-gratifying.
Feed with Vagina, Femspunk
You may not have a dinner bell, but comforting words seem to have the same effect on your body-mounted Mimbrane(s). The {parasite perks up/parasites perk up} at your offer, shedding the usual facsimile of normalcy to let you know {it’s/they’re} more than receptive. You can’t help but be a little entertained by the innocent squeaks and shuffling as you remove your [armor]. The prospect of rewarded attention seems to overcome much.
Laying your hand to your [pussy] reveals shockingly sensitive skin. {if pussy Mimbrane “The Mimbrane has prepped itself to hurry along your wanton finger massage”}{else “Mimbranes seem to have the innate ability to make your tender spots all the more delicate.”} The creatures have little interest in foreplay and are more than capable of exaggerating your stimulation when they aren’t trying to hide. Your [clit] may as well be a hardline to any sense of pleasure your being has ever known. Merely a few minutes is all it takes to get your juices {dripping/flowing/gushing/bursting}. 
Induced or not, it’s a little disconcerting.
{Pussy Mimbrane}Your [pussy] needn’t work hard for its take of your offering. The Mimbrane maw undulates slowly, absorbing what it would consider a hearty portion directly back into your pussy. It’s fairly breathtaking. Were you pressed to describe the feeling, “deep breathing” may be the most adequate description. Each little intake of femspunk back into your canyon is a radiating wave of bliss, crashing into your [clit]. The parasite exaggerates the movement, making it that much more difficult to even consider overlooking the provocative experience.
{Hand Mimbrane}The parasite ensconced over your hand helps itself while you make with the self-loving. It isn’t entirely clear who’s in control here, but either way your palm gets close enough to the goods for the Mimbrane to help itself. A charge of tingling clarity hits you with each tiny gulp, fueling your own actions further. Its only when the parasite finally fills to its meager brim do you come down from your brief sexual high.
{Both Hand Mimbranes}Both of your hands get in on the action, the Mimbrane-covered extremities anxious to partake in your feminine delight. You’re left questioning whether its them or you that’s suddenly turned this into a two-hand job. The ordeal fades from your mind, however, once the creatures start to indulge in your sexual fluids. Invigorating crests of pleasure march right through to your fingertips with each miniature gulp the parasites take. 
{Penis Mimbrane}Your eager [cock] can’t help but feel a tad betrayed as you milk your coosh for all its worth. The Mimbrane member is too engorged on blood, rocking through your ever-ascending sexual high, to bend down towards the {brook/stream/river/torrent} flowing below it. You don’t leave the parasitic rod waiting too long, however, dabbing your fingers in your juices and rubbing them generously onto your [cockhead]. Gentle squeaks let you know how content the Mimbrane is, and its absorption of your fluids fills your dick with streams of vibrant tidings. It’s a small wonder you don’t lose another load right there.
{Ass Mimbrane}A stroll down your taint leads to your [ass], clearly enthusiastic to get a piece of your delightful feminine broth. The Mimbrane spreads your buttocks almost uncomfortably wide as a couple of femspunk-coated fingers wind their way close. The parasite is presenting your [asshole] much like a pet’s whimpering mouth mere inches from a treat. Once you’re within range, it traps your hand with an unusually strong grasp. You try and pull your hand from from the cheeky constraint, but are subdued by the awe-inspiring sensations radiating from your pucker. Each little suckle and absorption of the enthusiastic Mimbrane is a turbocharged sexual pulse that defies expectations. It finishes its meal in short time, releasing your hand as it chirps playfully. 
{Scrotum Mimbrane}Your [sack] hangs above your [pussy], the Mimbrane frustrated that its placement of features renders it incapable of easily lapping at your feminine fountain. The squirming [balls] amuse and titillate you for a moment before you eventually cave in, delivering some of the coveted cargo all over its miniature, subdued face. The parasite delights in the feast, each of its tiny indulgences tickling your senses with comfortable blasts of passion.
{Breast Mimbrane}Dripping anticipation pours from your [fullchest]. The Mimbrane mounds are anxious for a taste of your pussy treats, bouncing and chirping softly. A moist hand delivers them what they seek, unsure which of your [nipples] to go to first. It makes little difference to the parasite so long as you eventually choose one. Your breast pushes back against your tender touch, massaging your hand as it sucks up your feminine fluids. It almost becomes a grope tug-of-war, though neither of you are all that competitive about it.
{Foot Mimbrane}If it had its way, your [foot] would very well dive into your [pussy], gorging itself on your female fountain. Too timid to try, the Mimbrane instead wiggles your toes impatiently to try and get your attention. The show works, as you bend your [leg] and bring the extremity closer to the action. Its angle keeps it from merely sucking from your puddle of femininity, but this inconvenience is quickly forgotten once you bring some liquid encouragement directly to its tiny mouth. You smear it vigorously under your toes, finding it odd for a brief moment before pulses of tingling comfort melt your regret away.
{Both Feet Mimbranes}Your [feet] wiggle anxiously, the Mimbranes hoping you won’t overlook them. You imagine they forget how hard it is to ignore any involuntary action thrust upon you. They aren’t kept waiting long as you bend your [legs] inward, presenting their infinitesimale mouths hiding under your toes, eager for a drop of your feminine fluids. Small dabs of femspunk are more than enough for their meager appetites. Each of their little indulgences tickles you down to your core. From toe to heel, the parasites push a surprisingly dense sensation of sexual invigoration right through you.
{Head Mimbrane}Your [face] feels as though it wants to pull off of your skull at just the thought of getting to your pussy juice. Its [lips] tremble pathetically. The Mimbrane acts as if it’d gone eons without food. You can’t help but smile at its melodrama, causing it to squeak helplessly at your apathy. The parasite purses your lips as you draw a couple fingerfuls of pussy nectar closeby, dying to get closer to the tiny oasis. Your fingers rub your face cushions, delighting the parasite to no end. The sensation of it absorbing your sexual vapors into your skin feels as if you were kissing pure desire. 
With {your Mimbrane/both Mimbranes/all of your Mimbranes} satisfied, you retrieve your [armor] and go back to something a little more self-gratifying.
Reproduction
//Once a Mimbrane has maxed out on feedings, it will no longer track days and go into a hunger state. It will still aid other hungry Mimbranes.
//Reproduction always occurs when the PC is asleep. Unnoticed Reproduction takes place when the PC awakes, normal reproduction takes place in the middle of sleep.
//Only Unnoticed Reproduction scenes occur at trust level 0 and 1. At trust levels 2-4, the reproduction scenes still only have a small chance to occur instead of the Unnoticed Reproduction. The chance raises with each level, potentially at 10, 20, and 30% respectively.
//Mimbrane resets to 0 feedings after reproduction, reseting all of its feeding-based effects on the organ. All parser activity in scenes reflects the enlarged organ.
Penis Mimbrane
Some totally awesome dream of yours fades away, chased away by an odd feeling. Going back to sleep is paramount until you again feel an odd straining in your [cock]. No longer concerned with pursuing your lost fantasy, you throw off your covers to figure out what is going on. The slab of meat has swollen considerably and appears to be erect, but you’re more concerned with the erratic twitching. When your cock spasms to one side, you finally notice that the Mimbrane’s eyes are wide open. The parasite appears to be under some heavy stress. Strangely, you feel fine despite knowing full well the second skin has worked all sorts of kinks into your nervous system.
Your convulsing dick lets out a long, drawn-out squeak. It feels a little- Suddenly the life just vanishes from the Mimbrane’s eyes. The distended pecker limps to one side. For a moment you’re concerned the little bastard is doing something malicious, but then your senses kick in. The Mimbrane is reproducing! {if repeat: “The vestiges of sleep must be why you forgot.”} The reason you aren’t being traumatized or being artificially thrusted to lust’s end is due to the parasite’s natural inclination to not alert its host to its actions. This one apparently isn’t entirely too concerned whether or not you’re awake for its performance.
A pressure besieges your pumped-up pecker suddenly. You can no longer feel the cool air of your ship on your manhood; it feels as if it were encased in concrete! Despite knowing this is a natural part of the creature’s life cycle, you’re unable to keep from worrying about your penis. A concerned grasp confirms it: you can’t feel your cock, at least not what’s in front of you. Nothing looks different - your [cock] doesn’t appear lifeless unlike the empty gaze of the parasite - but you may as well be pawing at a perfect replica of your fuckstick.
Bubbling on your [cockhead] grabs your attention. What appears to be an odd mixture of pre-cum and the Mimbrane’s oily secretion is drooling out of your opening. As odd as this looks, it pales in comparison when you start to feel a bizarre peeling sensation around your dick. You can feel your manhood shuffling around inside the imitation in front of you, flexing and wiggling as it separates itself from the phallic shell.
There is no pain, nor immense sexual pleasure. The best description of what you feel is like ridding yourself of a bandage or peeling off a latex glove. But your cock does feel incredibly tender and sensitive. You back away when your [cock] shuffles around again. Each shrug and shake separates your inner prick from the outer. Honestly, the whole ordeal is confusing. You feel your dick shedding its former self. You see your healthy-looking former prick dancing strangely around. 
Shockingly cool air hitting the base of your rod alerts you to the first clearly visible change. The Mimbrane is flaying off its former self right at the seam to your natural skin. Still you feel nothing more unusual than a sticker cleanly falling off your [skin]. Your eyes are trying to alert your brain to something horrendous happening, but the message is hit with skepticism. There is no ripping or tearing. You’re still unable to really perceive where the parasite ends and your real [skin] begins. But now it looks like you were just wearing a beautifully realistic sleeve.
Then the [cock] droops forward, and air rushes in through the opening. That’s when you realize just how slick your inner dick feels. You’re no longer shedding anything. The Mimbrane is slipping free. You can only watch in awe as your former cock just effortlessly glides off of you and flops onto the floor. Even now it still looks perfectly healthy and natural... until you gaze inside the hollow center to see the familiar texture of the underside of a natural Mimbrane.
The inquisitive stare is interrupted by a faintly sweet fragrance. Your {cocktype} dong – back to a size you’re familiar with – is soaking wet, coated in the mixture of cum and Mimbrane sweat you saw earlier. A finger running along your masculine length reveals how tender it is to the touch, more sensitive and raw than its ever been before. The parasite must-
The battle for your attention turns back to the replica penis on the ground, now writhing around with newfound life. The dead gaze has been replaced with a pair of clenched-shut eyes. Your former urethral opening is now working its way along the prick’s length, unfolding the cylinder to more closely resemble something closer to the Mimbrane’s more square appearance. 
It’s an odd sight to say the least. 
You aren’t quite sure how to feel about watching your former pride and joy cast aside its penile attributes. The newly formed parasite casts a gaze back at you, still resembling a cleanly flayed [cockhead]. Your fairly smaller cock throws its prodigy a quick little chirp.  And then it disappears into the darkness of your ship, crawling on its odd-looking four corners. Presumably it’ll finish out the rest of its transformation before sneaking its way off your vessel to continue on its life elsewhere.
Awkward silence is your only ally now. Your own Mimbrane has decided to call it a night and your dick seems to have done the same,  relaxing and drying back to something much more normal. All you can do is ponder over the interesting occurrence, the image of your [cock] flopping and crawling away from you burned into your mind.
Unnoticed Reproduction
Upon waking up, you’re surprised to find that your [cock] has reduced down to your average size. It feels a little tender; perhaps the Mimbrane was able to split off its offspring while you were asleep?
Vagina Mimbrane
One second you’re a mighty sexual {god/goddess}, dominating the galaxy armed only with your amazing body. The next second you’re listening to the hum of your ship. Eyes dart around in pursuit of your dream slayer, but it’s a curious straining down at your [pussy] that lets you know who the culprit was. Covers are tossed to the side, dim lighting revealing your spasming snatch. The Mimbrane’s miniature eyes are open as wide as they can manage. Something is wrong, but you sure as hell aren’t feeling anything stranger than the typical oddness that follows involuntary movement of your body. 
Strained little chirps and squeaks escape your folds as they stretch and clench. The puffed-up pussy looks to be going through some ordeal, clearly. For a brief moment you figure the parasite is up to no good, but then you remember your codex’s valuable information. The little creature is reproducing! {if repeat: “The vestiges of sleep must be why you forgot.”} The reason you aren’t being traumatized or being artificially thrusted to lust’s end is due to the parasite’s natural inclination to not alert its host to its actions. This one apparently isn’t entirely too concerned whether or not you’re awake for its performance.
The traumatized gaze of the Mimbrane goes blank. You wave a hand past to confirm the absence of life. In the process of waving, another realization crawls up into daylight: your [pussy] is numb. It looks normal and healthy, other than perhaps an overly plump appearance, but any attempts to manhandle it only feel like you’re tapping away at a fleshy shell. Prodding at your [clit] is a fruitless effort. It’s a relief that you recalled your electronic encyclopedia, otherwise you may be freaking the fuck out! Regardless, this is still disconcerting to say the least.
Liquid starts drooling out of your snatch suddenly, causing your wandering digits to back off. Swirls of clear and pink liquids make it look like a mixture of sexual fluids and Mimbrane sweat. You get a few moments to stare at the concoction before your snatch stirs yet again. Amongst all the contracting, straining and flexing you can make out a peeling sensation. Its as if your pussy were trapped under a rather bloated replica, struggling to free itself.
The liquid stream starts and stops in time with the convulsions. Each time you can make out a little more feminine flesh casting off from the hollow love box atop it. Should you help? The bizarre process is a little mesmerizing as it plays out, your half-awake senses too hypnotized to try and aid in the parasite’s natural cycle. Said senses do get a little jolt once the decidedly cool air seeps under your pussy-coating. It can be difficult to make out the finer details in the dim lighting of your quarters, so the mystery of where the parasite ends and your own [skin] begins remains just that.
Soon the unorthodox movements of your vagina stop from perfectly reflecting those of your outward flesh. The air makes it plainly obvious that your buried pussy is soaking wet, lubricating itself to cleanly rid itself of the second skin – or would this make it a third skin? The [pussy] keeps get looser, confusing you as its visual movements continue to not match up with what you can feel. It gets easier to perceive the box as a covering when more and more air sneaks in under the ever-expanding opening, kissing the underlying skin. 
One final, forceful push is all that remains before your former vagina slips down off your body. It’s as if it never was yours to begin with. In its place is a much smaller canyon, shining in a sheen of fluids and emitting the faint, yet unmistakable scent of Mimbrane secretion. With the involuntary action subsiding, you resume the courage to examine your slimed genitalia. Its sensitive and raw to the touch, feeling as fresh as you would have expected. Clearly this is straight off the Mimbrane production line.
Suddenly the withdrawn [pussy] between your legs shuffles and shakes, stealing away your attention. The once lifeless stare has found a new source of vigor, both eyes clenched shut as new life bursts forth in your former flesh. The gash fills and flattens, slightly working its way to resembling the more square appearance of a normal Mimbrane.
The thrashing calms and the new parasite looks up towards you, your erstwhile vagina pulsing rather lewdly. The Mimbrane still attached to you lets out a humble little squeak, causing a little reaction out of its offspring. But before the bizarre moment can get any more touching, the new pussy parasite awkwardly clamors away on its hastily fashioned four corners. It must be seeking any form of solitude to complete its transformation back into that of a normal Mimbrane. Once it’s finished, the creature will sneak its way off your ship to start out its own life.
Other than the odd movement and sleeker pussy, you aren’t much different now that everything’s said and done. Your Mimbrane tuckered itself out, and your tender cavern is quickly drying back to its natural moisture. Probably best to just go back to sleep...
Unnoticed Reproduction
Casting off the remnants of sleep, an odd realization strikes your crotch. Namely, your [pussy] is back to its normal size and qualities. Judging by the tenderness it exudes upon touch, it’s safe to assume the Mimbrane was able to shed its excess size into a new parasite.
Ass Mimbrane
A delightful romp through the idyllic dreamscape fades into whatever forgotten realm lost dreams subside. Something has pushed you out from slumber and into the dim silence of your idling ship. You lay motionless on your back staring at nothing in particular. For a moment you hope you’ll merely fade back unconsciousness, but a trembling shudder from your [butt] about scares you half to death. Covers fly off as you flip over; though you may be curious enough to investigate the disturbance, your half-conscious subconscious isn’t ready to completely surrender the notion of returning to sleep.
The moment your hind quarters aren’t pressed against your bed, strained squeaks and chirps escape your [butthole]. Its clear now that the strange spasms and anal contractions are due to this restless Mimbrane. Typically, sexual urges and depravity accompany strange, uncontrolled body complications. So its at least nice to know that no one slipped you something sinister. 
But then what is wrong with the parasite for it to suddenly send your bubble butt into a conniption? Is it hungry? Does the parasite long for your hind end to be ravaged by some uncouth cock? Its already driven your poor rear hole to a gaping moist mess. What more does it want? Then it hits you: your codex mentioned something about Mimbrane reproduction. The enthusiastic bugger has plumped your ass out so much that it must be ready to split off a new Mimbrane! 
{if repeat: “You’ve gone through this before, you remember.”} The reason you aren’t being traumatized or being artificially thrusted to lust’s end is due to the parasite’s natural inclination to not alert its host to its actions. This one apparently isn’t entirely too concerned whether or not you’re awake for its performance. Hell, if nothing else, the Mimbrane’s only gotten more lively now that it isn’t pressed up against your bed.
Just as your curiousity was to turn to cautious exploration, a numbing sensation overtakes your ass. A worried glare over your shoulder doesn’t alert you to anything new; all it makes out is the continued oddity of your parasitic bottom wiggling out of control. What you can’t see is the dead glaze that’s taken residence in the its little eyes. The Mimbrane’s consciousness has faded out from        its shell. 
You run your hands around your [ass] confirming its lack of feeling. But as you run your finger close to your [asshole], it suddenly clenches shut with amazing force! Your finger is unable to find any sort of purchase from what was once a cavernous wet den. Your  only guess is that the Mimbrane would rather not have its hole penetrated in any fashion right at the moment. You’re too groggy to get upset over this and challenge the little monster.
A peeling sensation from within your cheeks surprises you next. The parasite must be separating from its second skin. You can make out your new, smaller cheeks as they flex and pull against your [ass]. It were as if a comically large bandage were being taken off piece by piece from your supple fresh [skin]. Soon, air slinks in and kisses your bottom, letting you know that the parasite has managed to get the edges of its former flesh free. The sensation also alerts you to how moist and tender your behind is. Unbeknownst to you, your new cheeks are covered in a film of Mimbrane sweat.
A final tingling peel right at your still-clamped asshole is all that’s left of the parasite’s work. {if natural anal looseness ≤4 “As it pops off, you feel your asshole recover from some of the forced looseness brought on to you by the parasite.”} Your Mimbrane starts thrusting your posterior to the side, trying to slide its offspring off of you. However, your curiosity has grown too large for you to sit on the sidelines any longer, and you promptly grab the lifeless ass-shaped sheet sitting atop your moistened bottom. Your Mimbrane chirps in surprise, but you let the worried critter know you’ll let its prodigy free momentarily. How many other opportunities does one have to inspect a being such as this?
You remain laying on your front, uninterested in smearing your bedspread with the lingering coating of parasitic sweat on your bare bottom. Instead, you rest your head on its side and hold the former [butt] up with one hand. It’s an odd sight paired with the feeling in your grasp. On one side you can feel the [skin], see the unmistakable resemblance of your old bubble butt – [asshole] still forced shut. On the hollow inside, however, is the smooth, damp underside of a Mimbrane.
During one of your awe-filled glimpses of the ass oddity, the hollow former gaze of your Mimbrane gets a new burst of life. Once the new parasite realizes its stuck in your grasp, it flails wildly, forcing you into dropping it helplessly onto the floor. It flops around like the oddest looking fish you’ve ever seen, desperately trying to push out its four corners and get closer to its natural square shape, but it’s unable to hastily rid itself of your former appearance. 
Your Mimbrane chirps and squeaks again, which seems to bring ease to its offspring as it settles down. The [butt] stares up at you with a cautious gaze before crawling awkwardly into the shadows. 
That image will probably linger for some time.
As your own, slimmer Mimbrane bottom dries and calms down, you’re left to yourself and your thoughts. You at least recall from your codex that the new beastie will try and flee the instant the opportunity arrives. You just hope it doesn’t freak anyone out too much before that occurs. Your worry subsides as you slip back into the comforting embrace of sleep.
Unnoticed Reproduction
Your march back to consciousness is troubled by an odd feeling in your rear. Your [ass] has reverted to its usual size and qualities. It feels delicate to the touch; you suspect the Mimbrane managed to stealthily split off its offspring over the course of your slumber.
Scrotum Mimbrane 
The melodic hums of your ship surround you, a blissful sleep only resident in your memory. Something’s dragged you back to consciousness, but you’ll be damned if it’ll keep you here. Before you can toss and turn, however, that “something” materializes. Your [balls] are wiggling around something fierce! Covers fly to the side, fueled by your sudden anxiety that some manner of insect – or worse – has infiltrated your privates.
All you find is the Mimbrane that has already captured your cum pouch. Its normally well-hid little bumps for eyes look to be clenched shut, straining for some reason. The parasite is trembling about, rustling your [sack] every so often in its costive spasms. What’s gotten into this thing? Is it not enough that its already jacked up your [cum] factories? You’re tempted to grab onto the possessed purse, but your frustrated weariness is brutally stabbed by calm reason and blossoming memories. {if repeat: “You really ought to try and recall times like these more often before jumping to other conclusions. ”}The codex... it had discussed Mimbrane reproduction. Typically the parasite waits until the dead of night when its host is asleep to do the deed. This one has done a poor job of remaining concealed, or more likely it doesn’t mind you getting to bear witness to the magic.
Instead you decide it to better to spread your [legs] and give the struggling thing some room. Though the sensation of having your family jewels manipulated as such is particularly unordinary, you aren’t the least bit interested in not taking caution against them being caught or injured. Your role as spectator gets a little more interesting when the Mimbrane’s eyes burst open. There’s a strange hollowness to their gaze, however. What follows is an unsettling numbness overtaking your [balls]. Unable to keep your hands free of the action, some fingers along your [skinadj] balls confirm the lack of life.
They look fine, just as lax and healthy-looking as they were before you hit the hay. Reproduction or not, numbness in one’s genitalia is a fairly worthwhile cause for concern. A rustling within your sack keeps you from reaching for a directory to find a doctor. The rustling is followed by the feeling of your scrotum’s [skin] peeling deep within. Its similar to having them stick to your thighs on an especially humid summer day. Your pouch’s pliability makes the Mimbrane’s task easier, as you can tell its moving with directed swiftness in its separation.
But its still an extremely weird sensation.
Air brushes against your new balls, alerting you that the parasite has freed an edge of its former covering. A whiff of strawberries dances with a newfound dampness, now. Exposed to the open air, it’s become evident that the Mimbrane has coated itself in sweat to aid in the separation process. The creature makes short work of the ordeal, easily manipulating your malleable man-purse. Soon, you feel the former [skin] go lax and merely slide off you.
The former scrote-skin comes off cleanly, flattening out. It hardly resembles the [sack] it once appeared as outside of the clear appearance of [skinadj] flesh. You do spot its underside, standing out with its smooth, pink characteristics mirroring those of natural Mimbranes. 
Only a minute or two flutters by before the rag starts to shuffle around once again. The once-dead gaze of the parasite renews with a sense of life, peering around the room from its fleshy perch. The new Mimbrane is shocked when it catches your stare, but a calm squeak from its parent settles its fears. It pushes your former flesh around in an attempt to get closer to its square shape, but its having to work double time just in to get a little less flexible and flimsy.
Eventually the confused critter gets enough wits about it to fall off your bed and escape into the darkness of your ship. It will most likely befriend seclusion to aid in its transformation into a full-fledged Mimbrane. You recall that they typically will seek independence straight from birth; most likely this one will flee from your ship the instant the opportunity arises. 
Your balls appear smaller now, and they’re certainly not working as hard at production as before. Your Mimbrane seems to have passed out from all the excitement. You, however, find it a little more difficult to simply go back to sleep after the odd ordeal. But not too difficult.
Unnoticed Reproduction
While greeting the new day, an unfamiliar feeling on your crotch worries you. Upon investigation, you find that your [balls] have returned to their normal size and features. They feel soft to the touch; most likely your Mimbrane split off its offspring.
Breasts Mimbrane 
Sweet dreams are made of this. Who are you to disagree? You travel the world and the hum of your ship–
Groggy eyes stare at the uninteresting ceiling of your room. Some manner of slumber has been mercilessly slain, leaving you confused and awake. It isn’t entirely obvious why you woke up, but you aren’t all that interested in finding out. But find out you will, as your [fullchest] frightens you down to the core with a mighty shudder. The massive mounds are straining, trembling and wobbling as if possessed by some unholy demon!
When you hear – and feel – an exerted chirp from one of your [nipples], it becomes a lot more clear what the real deal is. Your chest-mounted Mimbrane seems to be having some sort of complication, flailing and shaking your titties around as a result. You attempt to calm the parasite, but it still shakes and thrusts in your grasp. Is it up to some new form of unusual mischief? Or maybe its getting ready to multiply? {if repeat “You would have noticed sooner that this was happening again had you not been so tired.”} It has to be reproducing, you figure, it matches what your codex taught you. Typically the parasite will wait until the dead of night to split off its accumulated mass into a fresh new Mimbrane. Typically they only act when their host is asleep, but it would appear that yours doesn’t mind you getting a glimpse of the action.
And get a glimpse you do. Laying on your back and staring at your chest, it’s mighty hard to miss the involuntary movements of your [breast]. You almost miss the strained expression on the parasite’s eyes, which soon after glaze over, devoid of life. The sight is troubling, but your attention moves elsewhere when your mighty bosom numbs over. The terror thought to be shed returns to your eyes as you paw away helplessly at your chest. Supple boobflesh appears normal and healthy – there’s still the telltale sign of [milk] drizzling from your [nipples] – but only faint sensations register deep under your [skin]. 
Again you calm. Overreacting isn’t really healthy. The best course of action, you figure, is to sit back and wait this out. You can already feel the parasite working away to separate itself from your now-excess boobage. Its as if thousands of tiny strips of tape were being plucked from your chest. Beneath this titty shell lies some incredibly sensitive, new breast-flesh. Its particularly titillating as the Mimbrane takes extra care around your nipples, slowly separating new from old.
Eventually the creature works it way to the edge of its covering, allowing air to race in and tickle your raw hide. You hadn’t realized before just how moist your new skin was. As the edges lift up, you can even see the escaping liquid. It’s made up of some mixture of [milk] and Mimbrane sweat from the look and smell of it. Before long, your [breasts] are but a hollow shell resting atop your sleek and slender new jubblies. 
They stir yet again when the Mimbrane beneath them starts rustling your chest to force off the bygone boobs. It’s tempting to aid, but you’re unusually enamored by the spectacle. Hell, it’s more tempting to get a pen and paper and write a poem involving boob cocoons or something. 
You’re still tired.
Mimbrane labor proves successful and the now-oversized molding of your chest flops to the ground with a wet thud. Even in the dim light of your quarters you can make out the non-stop jiggling of the [breasts]. Its hard to take your eyes off of them; they’re as perky and hearty as they were when they were on you! Temptation gets its pin count over your willpower, forcing you to reach down and inspect the milkduds. The hollow tits give in a lot more than yours of course. Also surprising is the underside: its pure Mimbrane, as smooth, pink, and moist as any other.
The odd grope comes to an end when one of your former breasts wrestles out of your hand. The old eyes of the Mimbrane have been enkindled with new life, and the Mimbrane appears to be scared to death of you. A calm set of squeaks and chirps from your nipples puts it at ease before it can run off. The parent must have let it know everything’s alright.
For a Mimbrane, your former chest seems like a lot of mass to work with. The fresh parasite seems to be having trouble adjusting to the weight, impeding its attempts to try and even slightly resemble its usual flat, square self. The creature manages the best it can, hobbling into the shadows. There’s no way you can’t snicker quietly at the view of your boobs jiggling away from you.
And that’s that. What’s left of your chest is drying quickly. The remaining parent seems to be sound asleep. Or just pretending, you can’t tell. Hopefully the mountains that hobbled out of your quarters will remain hidden long enough to transform into a normal Mimbrane and get lost. You figure it will. A breast-related dream will probably greet you on your way back to slumberville. 
Unnoticed Reproduction
As you bid farewell to your dreams, a significant loss in weight on your chest catches your attention. It would seem that your [fullchest] has returned back to its normal size and stature. Your supple mounds are a little tender to the touch, leading you to believe that your Mimbrane was able to split off its offspring while you were asleep.
Hands Mimbranes 
//Same scene for one or two hand Mimbranes with noted variations
Your eyelids very slowly rise, allowing what little light there is to rush into your dilating pupils. Something’s clocked you right into consciousness. Laying still for a few minutes doesn’t do much for you, so you sit on the edge of your bed and cradle your head in your hand{s}. Maybe you just need to get up and move around a bit or something. That’s when you feel it: your fingers are twitching and trembling. You pull your hand{s} back away from your face and notice {a trail/trails} of liquid hanging from your {cheek/cheeks} to your {palm/palms}. Seems your {Mimbrane is/Mimbranes are} having some sort of complication.
Staring at your somewhat bloated hand{s}, it’s plainly obvious that the {parasite is/parasites are} ready to multiply. At least, that’s what you hope is going on. Now would be a very poor time to find out whether or not Mimbranes can get sick. In your experience, the parasites are typically known to wait until the dead of night when a host is out like a light to split off their offspring. {This Mimbrane/These Mimbranes} must not mind too much if you catch {it/them} in the act, though. Or {it/they} just clumsily woke you up.
Your hand{s} go numb and {becomes/become} harder to move. Little parasite eyes blank out next, creeping you out with {a dead empty stare/dead empty stares}. You’re tempted to ball up your {hand into a fist/hands into fists} just to see what would happen, but think better of it. The numbing would make it incredibly awkward. You just remain the curious observer, hopeful that things go well.
You can feel your fingers peeling off of the now-extra flesh, [skin] pulling away in a manner you could never achieve. Each digit shuffles and moves independently, but never too much. The procedure must be on a smaller scale than you had figured. Soon, cool air skates across your wrist{s} and onto tender skin. {An edge has/Edges have} started to appear. It begins to feel as if you’re wearing {a skin-tight glove/skin-tight gloves} now.
{This glove/These gloves} are itching to come off. Some liquid trails down your arm from underneath the faux skin. Judging by the smell and appearance, it seems to be Mimbrane sweat. As more space opens up, you realize that your {hand is/hands are} drenched in the stuff. The Mimbrane{s} must be using it as lubricant. Luckily it doesn’t seem to be very concentrated, judging by your lack of any new sexual desires.
Out of the clear blue your {hand lurches/hands lurch} forward, drooping towards the ground. The sudden action in the dead of night is frightening, but you’re more worried about anyone catching you with a visibly limp wrist. Thankfully, you aren’t stuck like this long. The [skinadj] {mitt slides/mitts slide} off your hand{s}, landing on the floor with a moist thud. What’s left on you {is a/are some} rather slim and sensitive hand{s}, still particularly drenched in Mimbrane fluid. You peer back down to the ground, expecting to see a monster movie-style disembodied hand crawl away on fingers or something. 
What actually happens is a tad less impressive. The back{s} of the hollow, flattened hand{s} start{s} to split open, revealing smooth, pink Mimbrane underside{s}.  The once inert visage{s} of the palm-based eyes find life once more, staring frantically around the room. The Mimbrane{s} are kept from panicking when {its/their} still-attached {parent puts it/parents put them} at ease with soft squeaks and chirps. 
You’re still trying to process the bizarre sight of {a} split-open hand... glove... <i>thing{s}</i>. It never really fully connects for you before the {parasite hobbles/parasites hobble} away into the darkness, not even remotely resembling the typically square Mimbrane shape. The creature{s} must have sought out some seclusion before {it/they} could begin to attempt to shed the remains of your likeness.
Only awkward silence sits with you now. Your {Mimbrane is/Mimbranes are} fast asleep and drying rapidly. Perhaps it’d be best to just go back to sleep yourself...
Unnoticed Reproduction
The dulcet tones of an idling spaceship hoist you from your sleep just in time for you to notice something off about your hand(s). Namely, {it has/they have} reduced back to {its/their} normal size. Judging by the slightly raw feeling in your [skin], you imagine that the Mimbrane(s) {was/were} able to split off {its/their} offspring. 
Feet Mimbranes 
The ceiling is very good at winning at staring contests. You are merely studying under its keen ways. Sleep has abandoned you and moving about seems fruitless. So, you stare endlessly at nothing. Something dragged you from your comfy dreams, but there’s no telling what– 
Your {[foot]/[feet]} spasms suddenly. Toes clench and stretch. Has some nerve disorder crept within you? Has fucking the galaxy’s many offerings proven to be your undoing? Throwing your covers off rids you of these qualms. Its merely your Mimbrane{s}, judging by the strained look in {its/their} eyes. Your {[foot] has/[feet] have} been looking pretty swollen lately. It must be time to split off some offspring, you figure. Normally Mimbranes handle this when their hosts are snoozing away, but it would yours {doesn’t/don’t} mind the company.
{It acts/They act} quickly, beginning with a sudden numbness overtaking your {foot/feet}. You imagine it would be immensely uncomfortable if you were to try and stand right now. Next, the life disappears from the {parasite’s/parasites’} eyes. {It/They} must be separating its consciousness from the now-surplus skin. It’s hard to imagine what that must be like. 
The process continues as tiny peeling sensations blossom up all around your {foot/feet}. The {Mimbrane is/Mimbrane are} manipulating your skin on a magnitude much smaller than your joints would account for. It’s as if multitudes of tiny strips of tape were all being peeled away. 
Air smacking against your ankle{s} lets you know the {parasite has/parasites have} worked {its way to its edge/their way to their edge}. Not only that, but you’re also made aware how wet your {foot is/feet are}. Judging from the slight sense of strawberries and the hint of a tingle, you guess it must be Mimbrane sweat. The parasite{s} must be using it as a lubricant. It only takes a few more minutes of peeling, wiggling, sliding and contracting until you seemingly have {a/a pair of} [skinadj] socks...
Your {[foot] flicks/[feet] flick} forward involuntarily, working to slide the new Mimbrane{s} off {it/them}. It works, and the hollow, bloated {casting of your foot falls/castings of your feet fall} to the ground, Mimbrane slime oozing out the top{s}. You scoot forward to get a good look, seeing just what you’d expect: {a sock that used to resemble your foot/socks that used to resemble your feet}. Maybe {it’ll/they’ll} start walking off on its own or something.
It’s much less satisfying – but no less strange – when the castoff skin{s} begin{s} to peel down the back and along the underside, revealing to you that the underside of a Mimbrane lies beneath what still visibly looks like your [skin]. You figured {it’d/they’d} compress rather than split, honestly. Just as {it’s/their} eyes start to show a re-found sense of life, your Mimbrane{s} chirp and squeak at {its/their} children. 
The new {Mimbrane stares/Mimbranes stare} up  at you for a moment, wiggling {its/their} hollow toes. Then {it takes/they take} off into the darkness, escaping to some forgotten corner of your ship to complete transformation. You’re left trying to think about what just took place and hope no one falls across some bizarre amalgamation of foot and Mimbrane. {It/They} should be able to escape without garnering any attention, you figure. 
Best to just get back to sleep than dwell on it any further.
Unnoticed Reproduction
Slowly crawling back to the land of the conscious, a different feeling radiates from your {[foot]/[feet]}. {It appears/They appear} to have returned to {its/their} normal size. Based on the tender feeling you get while rubbing your toes, its safe to assume that your Mimbrane(s) {was/were} able to split off {its/their} offspring. 
Head Mimbrane 
//Following is for first instance only
“Anything you want want before I head out for the night?” Victor asks. You stare around the room blankly, trying to think if you left anything out. Nothing comes to mind, and you tell him as much. Your father gives you a slight little wave and heads out the door.
Wait! An ice cream cone would be great! You jump over the coffee table and barrel down towards the door to catch him before he’s gone. Inky blackness is all that greets you. Which way did he go? You squint and strain, but can’t make out any details. Nothing’s clear. Nothing doing but to go back inside.
As you close the door behind you, something starts to seem off. It’s hard to focus on anything around you. Some instinct in the back of your head tells you to look at your hand and try to count your fingers.
You can’t. Nothing looks wrong, but you just can’t. You have an idea of what’s going on. Next you poke your index finger against the palm of your hand, pushing hard. It pokes out the other side of your hand with ease.
You’re dreaming. Those lucid dreaming techniques you read on the extranet paid off! But now everything’s getting even more unstable, like you’re being sucked out! What was it they said to do...oh! Rub your hands together and try spinning in place! 
You’re back in your quarters now instead of the listless room of before, back to your normal self. Looks like it worked! There’s a higher sense of clarity to your surroundings now. Looking around the room, you realize you’ve started flying without even thinking about it. It is the most common dream sensation, after all. Try not to get too excited, you remind yourself. If you want to make the most of this little head vacation, you’ll have to get ensconced in some little activity.
But what first?
[Talk to subconscious] [Orgy] [Find Follower] [Find Victor] [Fly in Space]
//all options lead here
No! Nooo! What happened!
You’re awake! How! Why! You did everything you’re supposed to, right? What went wrong? 
//Following is for second instance onward
Something’s escorted you away from blissful slumber. Your ship is as silent as always, never the cheeriest of greeters. Dazed eyes peer around the room, curious to find anything out of the ordinary. They find nothing. Did you just wake up for no reason?
//Converge here
All concerns vanish from your head when your {lips} suddenly tremble and constrict! Hell, your whole head feels as if it were trying to rip itself apart, and not in that cute little headache way. You can actually feel the [skin] on your skull tensing and shifting ever so slightly, like an eyelid twitch pushed to an obscene level. There’s little doubt in your mind as to the reason for this uncomfortable phenomenon: Mimbrane.
More specifically Mimbrane reproduction. You’ve been feeling a little fat-headed lately, and it doesn’t have anything to do with your intelligence. Someone could rent your lips out as a bounce house, and your [face] feels a little puffy even if it doesn’t look it. You know from your codex that the parasite prefers to wait until their host is in slumber’s embrace before attempting to multiply. Your head-mounted friend already seemed pretty cool with you from the get-go; it must not mind if you wake up to watch it make some children.
Your instincts are to paw at your face, hands desperate to get a grip on the writhing flesh around your head. It takes a lot of willpower to merely keep still, controlling your breathing through your nose with your mouth acting as if it were in great pain. The Mimbrane’s little squeaks and chirps through your bimbo-esque lips are audible enough as it is. One feature you can’t see is the sudden dead-eye glare in the parasite’s miniscule eyes. 
It’s only a sign for what’s to come. A numbness shrouds your head. You can’t decide if it feels like you’re wearing a mask or went through a really lousy trip to the dentist. All that’s certain is that it’s uncomfortable. But you maintain your calm. Freaking out or getting upset won’t get you anywhere, you remind yourself. It’ll only make things worse. And making things worse is stupidly easy when you can’t feel a thing.
The Mimbrane goes to work underneath the [skin] of your head. Now it definitely feels like you just have excess weight overy our noggin. You can make out your [face] wriggling free, peeling away from its outer shell. Individual strands of hair are imbued with life and push against their thin coating. Though you’re fully aware an organism is posing as the skin to your head, you’ve never really been reminded of the fact quite like you are right now. Down to every cell is some manner of self-locomotion that you could never hope to naturally achieve.
Everything feels heavy. Even your eyelids feel like something’s sitting on them. Your mouth especially feels pinned down by the [lips] atop it. Maintaining a relaxed composure is odd at the very least. You’re used to <i>one</i> sort of facial, but not this. There’s no rhyme or reason as to what parts of your new face smoothly separates from your old one. Your scalp pulls away, cheeks follow, ears bend and flex, nose twitches, lids constrict{, muzzle shifts}... it’s a neverending stream of simply bizarre facial movements and sensations.
The experience culminates when air runs up along your neck and underneath your [face]. It’s incredibly cool, or rather your new skin is incredibly tender. Not only that, but you hadn’t realized how wet it was. As the crease expands, you notice trickles of liquid skipping down your neck. The faint scent reveals the substance’s identity: it’s Mimbrane sweat. The oily, strawberry-scented fluid must be the key ingredient from keeping this molting from turning into a horror show.
Before long, your head’s new outer shell is completely loose, draped awkwardly in places. It’s actually quite interesting: you can feel where the Mimbrane stores most of its nutrition. Fleshy bits like your ears and especially your lips are obvious, and thin parts like your forehead and scalp are equally lean. The parasite moves your [skin] in a wave-like motion, attempting to push the remains of your former head-covering up and off your head. This is as good as any time to intervene, you figure, as the creature seems to be having a little trouble. It also feels really weird.
You calmly sit up and pull the faux head off, much to the Mimbrane’s surprise. It chirps softly, but you quiet it with a gentle reassurance. It glides off easily, revealing the moist, matted mess your head is now. The hollow shell collapses in your grasp, an odd sight to see when the rest of the mask looks exactly like your head. Well, if you ignore that this thing is dry and still sports [lips] that put your now-slimmer ones to shame.
Looking through the empty sockets where your eyes once were, you can see the inside of the skin is normal Mimbrane. That smooth, pink barely textured surface couldn’t be mistaken for much else. There’s a slight hint of macabre humor in your head handling this perfect replica of your pate. You could hang them up around your room, telling the tale of how you beheaded and flayed an evil army of [Name]-clones that threatened you, making a clear message for any stragglers.
Sadly, your empty boasting flutters away when the bloated lips shuffle around and the dead glaze of a gaze springs to life. You had secretly hoped that this new Mimbrane would use your former head much in the same manner as you did, just so things would be extra weird. But instead it flops awkwardly out of your hands to try and scammer off your bed. Its parent chirps at it before it gets too far along, calming the oddity down before things get too out of hand.
The back of the fleshy mask cleanly splits, getting the Mimbrane one tiny step closer to the flat, square appearance it wants to achieve. You can only watch in awe at the thing, your split-open chubby mirror self reminding you of some popular horror vids. You hope to some deity that this thing doesn’t cross paths with another soul before it can completely cast off any semblance of your appearance. It disappears into the darkness of your ship after trading unintelligible pleasantries with your head-mounted parasite.
Your Mimbrane calms down and apparently goes to sleep, leaving you alone once again. You run a hand your [hair], finding it surprisingly dry compared to just a few moments earlier. Indeed, your entire head is closer to its normal moisture. Though it is still feeling mighty sensitive. That feeling, that notion that you are merely rubbing some manner of critter wrapped around your head only resides in your mind again. Your senses tell you everything’s normal again.
Normal. That’s a word you’d rather forget. You go to sleep, anxious to redefine “normal” for another day.
Unnoticed Reproduction
Upon stretching off the last vestiges of sleep, you notice something feels off about your [face]. It would appear that your [lips] have shrunk down to their normal size. In fact, your entire head feels a little raw and fresh, for lack of a more appropriate description. Somehow, your head-mounted Mimbrane managed to reproduce while you were knocked out.
